"It's pretty scary. I think I'll be fine, things have been going well for a while.

Anyone got any stories about hotlines they'd like to share? 

I remember I first called the Samaritans at 116 123 one night because I was feeling suicidal. A kind man named Terry answered the phone and began

'Hello, you've reached the Samaritans - how are you tonight?'

'Um...hello,' I said, 'I'm feeling...uh...pretty suicidal right now.'

I expected the whole thing to be very uncomfortable and clinical exchange but in fact it was the complete opposite.Terry probably saved my life that night.",3
"Throwaway account because this is fucking embarrassing and I don't want it on my real account. I was just chilling watching rogue one, drinking a beer when I kept seeing my self squeezing the glass so hard it shatters in my hand. It was like a clip playing on a loop, I had to set the glass down because I was afraid I'd actually do it. Now I can't stop thinking about self harming, which I haven't done since I was 15, that was 8 years ago. I can't distract myself from these thoughts anymore, I know I'm going relapse into my eating disorder and I'm just fucking exhausted with this. Happy new year y'all. ",3
"Well calling them friends is just nosense. 
I said to them that i was sick this last day of the year because when i'm out with them they are just making fun of me because i'm 1.70. 
To my parents, i said that i would go out and they went at a restaurant with other people.
Lol. All went down after high school.
I'm so done, i'm gonna play some league of legends.
Best wishes to all of you

"I am a line cook, I have been for five years. At this rate, this may be my fate for the rest of my life. 

Iâm currently getting a marketing degree, but Iâm honestly not too sure what I will do with it. Iâm pretty anxious, so talking to people and selling things can be tough, though Iâm pretty good at talking when I know what Iâm talking about. 

Working in a kitchen is such an easy trap to fall into. I can make about 25,000 a year doing it, and cooking is a passion of mine. Iâm afraid that I wonât be able to get a âreal jobâ and Iâll be stuck here the rest of my life.

"Turns out no self-esteem for years really ruins your life. Due to this I developed major and chronic depression. Know exactly what I need to do, can't do it.

You don't just rebuild self-esteem over days, weeks, months, or even years. This takes decades. 

Decades of kindness, decades of acceptance, decades of love. It's real hard to get that as someone who feels like every breath is robbing another of oxygen.

Pretty sure it's game over for my mental health. Oh well. Maybe I can learn to live without these things but 4+ years of trying make me weary, y'know.

Anyways my life sucks, your life might suck, but supposedly life in general doesn't suck. Hard to believe I know.",1

"This is really long btw. So if nobody reads it I understand

I donât even know how to start this off. Iâm just in so much pain. My mind has become my prison. I have so much self hatred. Iâm also self destructive. 

I moved halfway across the country after high school cause I thought itâd make me happy. Start new and leave all the negative behind. Move in with my dad and start working full time. I eventually move out to my own place. I was so unhappy about my job. I would also feel embarrassed to tell people where I worked. 

So my new mission was to find a better job. Family member hooked me up with a really great job. For a 21 year old kid with no degree this job was great. I was prob making too much money for someone my age lol. A lot of dumb spending and lots of drunk nights. 

The job really did help me out. I use to live in this duplex that had nasty carpet. I had no furniture and I had no plates or anything of that nature. Just my bedroom stuff, one entertainment center with a tv in my living room, and some rickety old stained blue recliner. 

Eventually I put down wood floors and furnished my entire place from top to bottom in a matter of months. I even opened up a good credit card and started building my credit. Was the first time in my life I was able to save money and not live paycheck to paycheck. Lol I even had a health savings account that later paid to have my wisdom teeth removed. I really went far and I was proud of myself for once. 

It just wasnât enough though. I was still in so much pain. A job I loved turned into a job I loathed. I think I was genuinely happy for a couple months max. I ended up working there for two years and some change. 

I left when I decided I should go to school. Iâm in a town with a great school and my family has gone to this school for generations. So I put in a month notice at my job and started taking steps to get myself ready for the college life. 

My first semester was a breath of fresh air. I loved it. I loved going to class and doing something I actually wanted to do. That lasted for a whole semester and a minimester. My next full semester? I almost failed this semester. I was very close to getting out on academic suspension. I stopped going to class halfway through. I donât even know if I want to do it anymore.

Iâm just running in circles. I think something will be good for me and I go and do it. It helps for s couple of months then Iâm back to square one. The amount of hate I have for myself in just ridiculous. I donât think I hate anything even remotely close tot he way I hate myself. 

At my school getting your ring is a big deal. Man I cannot fucking wait to get it either. But after I get it then what? Will it really make me happy?What happens when I finish my degree? Will I be happy then? Will I want more? What happens when I get a job I want? Will that be the turning point? Nothing is enough for me. It just keeps going. Itâs a never ending pursuit of nothing. Fucking nothing. 

Iâm visiting my friends in another state right now. 
Reconnected with an old friend. (Not the one Iâm staying with). Things went well and things kind of flames out. Wasnât good. This year comes around and things actually go through. She was very standoffish though after we were with each other the first night. I thought maybe I did something wrong. She continued to be short with me the next day. Then I went and got hammered for the football game and sent some dumb ass drunk texts and I think Iâve really fucked it up now. She didnât even want to talk to me the next day after.

We are suppose to do something tonight for New Years. However, I feel that wonât go through. I just went a fucked it all up with some stupid drunk texts man. 

I just canât get a win and if I do get a win it helps me out for a month. 

Iâm a hypocrite, a liar, selfish, and just about everything else. Iâm just out here dying and Iâm getting closer everyday to just saying âfuck itâ. I just donât know how much more I can take. Iâve been dealing with since this I was 15. I just didnât know what I was when I was that young. 

I donât know how far into 2018 Iâm going to make it. 2018 might be the last year of my existence. ",2
"I found out accidentally last week that all of my friends are going to another one of my friend's party. I was not invited. My one friend who isn't going isn't responding to my texts. So now I'm alone at my house with Chinese food and beer. This past month I've felt more alone than I've ever have and i don't know how to deal with it. I'm starting to realize my place in friendships as the excess, the one who is forgotten or dismissed. This NYE was the icing to the cake. I'm hoping that 2017 will be better but it's not promising. Does this feeling of loneliness ever get better? Im scared that if I don't do something about it, it'll spiral out of control and that terrifies me",1
"My family, my friends, I care about all of them. Very deeply. But Iâm a ghost. Its funny, Iâm typing all this out with a smile on my face. Iâm in a great mood, had a fun day, played some video games online with my brother, had lunch with my sister, spent a bit of time with my roommates. I love all of them very much, but they donât know theyâre talking to a ghost. Iâm alive, Iâm somewhat happy in a way, but I havenât been entirely âhereâ in a long time. Itâs like a part of me is somewhere else, a far away place Iâll never reach. I have lived in this depression for so long that itâs become my home, itâs not something I think I can escape anymore. Itâs an old friend, always here, not always making itâs presence obvious. But itâs there. Itâs always been there. My one constant companion.

"so.. hi... im a 17 y/o guy living in southern mississippi. i have a girlfriend whos younger than me. and at first everything felt great, she made me happy. first of all some background, ive struggled with depression for almost my whole life considering i was bullied hard in elementary and middle school. the sadness strengthened its grip on my throat around freshman year of highschool because of a break up i went through, and yeah i know its stupid. but anyways after that, i lost my religion after a while and growing up in south mississippi if youre not christian youre fucked. i also eventually stopped being straight. even worse. after all this i got around 11th grade and school was fucking my life up and just making me so stressed i started having heart palpitations. okay now back to what i was gonna say before. everythings great between me and her. its just she used to make the bad thoughts go away, but now theyre back and they brought a fucking army. i just dont know what to do anymore. ive pretty much given up on ever feeling happiness again. honestly, it feels like all color is just fading away.",1
"With the new year starting tomorrow and me being introverted. I'm confused on what do to tonight. 

I feel very alone around the holidays and try to make an effort to be with people because if I don't then I start a pattern of self-deprecation and self-hate and thoughts of suicide start to creep in.

My parents and brother are going to a friend's house (two of my former teachers) to ""have a good time of fellowship"" and blast fireworks at midnight. Totally sober. They want me there. I plan on drinking tonight and it would not be allowed for me to drink around my parents and their friends or my brother.

I have a friend that I went to high school with and we are good friends, like the type where we can go without talking or seeing each other for months but when we see each other we're still good friends. She kind of invited me over to her boyfriend's house for tonight. He works for a beer distribution center and has loads of beer. They smoke weed and have also told me about times when they've done cocaine. I want to spend time with my friend but I don't want to partake in smoking or snorting tonight. I think I have an addictive personality and cocaine might not be a good thing for me to try. Also i really don't want to get crossfaded. I'm not really sure if I should go to her boyfriend's house.

It seems like I only have a couple options, be stone sober with boring people and watch fireworks, be drunk with a friend and her boyfriend where coke might be available, or sit at home with my own stash of booze and bring in the new year alone.",3

This year was a shit, the finances in my house were rockbottom, the health problems get bigger by the time and the success is not even around us, but I'm by my own, right?
Just had a motorcycle accident the day before yesterday and it was definitely a mistake. I'm not sorry for what happened to me but now my family is busting it all over me, saying that I'm irresponsible, that I don't do good on school, that I'm rude. But I just can get through this. I'm 18 and tired of this life, how can I get over all this bullshit? If I think that I want this to end its good, if it does happen my sister will not worry about my bad behaviour, my mom will not scream my name anymore and there will be less to spend in their life. BUT, will they live with it for the rest of their life with this? I don't want that to them. How can I solve this thing that's called life?

"I'm am a 15 year old male who has depression. I been bullied throughout my life, ignored, look down upon, and even laughed at for being stupid. Depression has taken a lot on me and I can't deal with it anymore. People I try to talk to at school just ignore me or talk to my so called friends around me who also ignored me, and it just makes me filled with rage, sadness, and envy. I helped those people in the past and they don't repay me back. I sit alone at lunch, and basically just a loner in general. My family doesn't know I have depression and I don't want to tell them because it will make them sad and I love them.I will probably  kill myself later this year, or during the school year and see how much they care.( Probly won't), but hey, at least I'm passing my classing with a, and b's.

"I havenât gone to see a shrink yet but I feel like I need to. Everyday I feel miserable about my family being poor. Weâre not even THAT poor. But itâs more like I wish we were rich. Being poor sucks. I feel ashamed everyday because of our poverty. It really sucks when youâre surrounded by rich people. We have rich relatives. I have rich friends. I have rich classmates because Iâm in law school and I canât help but compare my life to theirs. They have cars and always have nice and new clothes.

"Hello all. Iâm a college freshman home for winter break. Iâm feeling really alone. My old friend group from high school kinda grew away from me as I went to a different high school, so Iâve been seeing plenty of snaps and Facebook posts about them hanging out together and being really close but have never been invited or even reached out to. I was really close to church friends through my junior year but I basically vanished my senior year because my dad left my family, I had to work, and I had to get myself a scholarship to college (which I did). Theyâre all like a big family, and while they include me in stuff, I cannot escape the feeling that Iâm just a guest there, not a member of that family. 
I did get a full ride to William and Mary (Iâm from Florida), which meant I go to school out of state, while most of them going to state schools. Most of them still see each other all the time and are super close, while Iâve had to start over. It kinda hurts to see my college friends hanging out with their friends from home and still being super close to them while I donât really have that luxury.
There is one guy who I think Iâll be friends with the rest of my life. He was my best buddy in high school and weâre still really close. And my girlfriend, who goes to school in DC, is home too so I can see her. Iâm grateful for them but wish I had a bigger friend group from home that I was still close to.
Iâve loved college, but havenât really found a new best friend yet. Iâve still kinda struggled with feeling like an outsider and not really fitting in. I have plenty of surface friends, but I want a close, supportive friend group more than anything in the world, and I hope itâs not too late. Is it?
Can anyone relate to this? Is it weird to not be close with people from high school? How can I get rid of these feelings of loneliness and feeling like Iâm a failure? How can I find what Iâm looking for in college?",2
"i ended 2016 as a recent graduate from a top notch university with a degree in probably the most unemployable field, 30k+ in debt, back at home, and cut off ties with all friends.

i predicted that 2017 would bring me a mediocre job i could've gotten in high school, that i probably wouldn't last a few months at that job, that my parents would be paying off my loans because i can't, and that i would probably stay in my room 90% of the year.

it all became true. i lasted only the training period of my job and resigned 1 week into the first full week of work. my parents' have paid 8 months for my student loans. i'm not paying rent. i'm well fed. and despite having only seen friends only 3 days at the beginning of the year then ending them off with an argument or complete silence on my end, i'm okay with it. birthday and holiday greetings unreplied to. concerned voicemails and texts gradually decreasing from daily to weekly, to monthly, to never.

as for 2018, i only predict the same. no contact with friends. me still leeching off of my parents. maybe they'll snap one day and tell me to go back to a job that i'll only end up resigning yet again because of anxiety. maybe i'll stay at the job out of guilt.

it's gotten to a point where i'm not even sad for myself. i've just accepted it. i'm just one of those examples of the ""smart"" kid growing up, following the rules, the teacher's pet that becomes unsuccessful because they only know how to live by what others tell them to do. yet, i can't even succeed in the system because once i finally made mistakes, i never knew how to cope, even up to now. and that's where i'm at. in this limbo of being an ""adult"" yet living as if i were a toddler. maybe the saddest part is my parents tolerate it.

i know at some point things will have to change. it's the in-between of not knowing what the next step is or what will fix my situation that leaves me feeling like there i don't have a reason to exist.",2

"Okay so this is the story of how I had everything a 19 year could possibly want and how I lost it just as fast. I had everything. I had a loyal gf, I had a good paying job, a car, had lots of friends who I considered ""brothers"", I had a good relationship with my mom and sisters, I was going out every weekend having fun. Everything was perfect. I had never been so happy in my life. I was saving up for a newer car, for college, I was planning lots of great things for myself. I thought maybe I had finally gotten into the right track. I started hanging out with the wrong people though. I knew it was wrong but I didn't think I would ever get caught. We would go out at night and go through people's cars , steal whatever was valuable, credit cards, wallets, purses, electronics, guns, whatever we thought we could get money for. I was going on $1000 shopping sprees. One night I went out by myself and got caught. I was arrested, put in jail for 3 days and then I bonded out. My bond was $13,500 for 5 counts of felony entering auto, and 1 count of prowling. That's when my life flipped upside down. I know i put myself in that situation. I don't blame anyone else. Suddenly I had nothing. My friends I considered ""brothers"" didn't ever call to check up, they weren't even worried. So I had no friends now. No car. No money. (I hired a decent lawyer but she charged $4000). I lost my job in which I had just gotten a raise . I got a new one but it's a job I hate for less the money I was making back then. All my money goes to my lawyer, rent, and bills. I haven't bought myself anything in over 4 months. I'm not a citizen of the United States so if my lawyer can't drop find a way to drop the charges then I'm going to get deported back to Colombia where I was born. I haven't been there in 15 years since I was 4. So now I had the stress of not even knowing if I was going to be able to stay in the country with my mom and 4 sisters. If I was going to be able to stay with my girlfriend. I had no way of seeing her because I didn't have a car, no money to take her out, no friends to go out with. So I started pushing her away, avoiding texts, avoiding calls, avoiding chances to meet up. I knew how much she loved me, she was head over heels, I've never seen someone love me so much. But I didn't want her to fall more and then me get deported. That would have crushed her. So I continued pushing her away, every argument I would suggest breaking up. So one day I just did it , I broke up with her. Blocked her on all social media. I miss her tho but she is already talking to someone else. Now that I'm trying to meet new people I can't seem to be genuinely interested in. What they tell me about them and about their lives. I want to care. But I just don't. I want to be social, and active and positive and all these good things but I just can't. It's always in the back of my head. A little voice telling me, what's the point of getting to know them, what's the point of texting them back ? You're going to get deported in a couple months anyways. I talk to a girl for 1-2 days and then I stop talking to them all together . I don't even find joy in things that I used to love, like soccer , I tell myself what's the point in going. To go play if you're gonna get deported in a couple months. I want to be able to live productively , positively, I want to just live but this court case is holding me back. The thought of this impending doom in holding me back and I'm letting life pass in front of me. Idk what to do. ",1
"Iâve been working on my 3rd year uni law essays every day for over a month, sitting at the same desk reading the same words writing the same thing on the same screen. I wake up, work, go to bed. I havenât been out or socialised with anyone. It feels like Groundhog Day.

&gt; Hello /////-

&gt; Thanks for sharing information related to your medical and mental health history. It is evident that you are being intentional about being open about your history , symptoms and experiences. Please remember that being open and willing to work through things that are blocking your current progress and ""fueling"" ongoing mood symptoms and making interpersonal functioning difficult is KEY to reducing your symptoms and rebuilding your life.

The possibilities are endless!


*If you need any other information regarding those things, let me know.*

*As for how this has affected my views, well. Most of them are not good, except when they are. At my best, I would consider myself an optimistic nihilist. At my worst, I wouldn't know. My view on myself is that I am pointless, worthless, a failure, important to no one in any meaningful way, and completely incapable of doing anything I would enjoy in life, much less anything productive or helpful to others. Except for the times it isn't, where I can acknowledge and even enjoy my strong suits. People actively seek to befriend me and I have had strong relationships.*
*I am aware that I have value to myself and others, and even sometimes enjoy what few things I've done for myself. I've seen some interesting things, been to some interesting places. My opinions and views on literally everything shift from moment to moment, or mood to mood. Life and the world we live in is equaled in beauty only by it's brutality. Fair in its unfairness, harmonious in its discord. In life, one man may experience heaven and for it another man will experience hell. In the end, we are all the same life, being lived out through different circumstances.*

*How I feel largely dictates how I see everything in that particular moment. Sometimes it's balanced and calm, many times it is bitter and indignant. My place in this life it is mine to chose, but there is nothing I have considered that has moved me to the point of choosing to do it. Nothing about myself matters enough that I would ever do anything to better my situation or make my own life one that I would be proud to have lived. Even this may be an attempt to better myself, but it is not FOR myself. I'm doing it because I want to make someone else happier without losing them, to be better FOR THEM, not for me. I do not care about myself.*

*I have only rarely mentioned these things to people. My family knows, but, that's about it. I have told the current woman I am in a relationship with of some of my history, including the abuse, but certainly not most of it. Certainly not the experiences with drugs or some of the worse things I've seen, and done.*

*The relationship with my siblings is strained, at best. I have no idea where to even begin. I grew up with two brothers. One older by a year, one younger by a year. Our path from childhood to adulthood was spent making attempts to murder or inflict serious injury on each other, interspersed with brief moments of kinship. I can honestly say that I have very few, almost zero, good memories of either of them to this day, None of us had doors to our rooms because we kept destroying them, breaking them down each time one of us would start a fight and then run away.*

*There was an occasion I recall where an uncle of ours entered onto an altercation where I had a knife to the throat of my younger brother because he had antagonized me to the point of nearly killing him, meanwhile he laughed uncontrollably having been pleased with himself for doing so. He had once put rusty nails and screws into eggfoam outside my room and caused me to have over fifteen holes in my left foot when I stepped on it not thinking there would be anything in it. The older brother had a bunch of douchebag friends who themselves were basically bullies and awful to be around, and he himself was extremely violent. He was a Juggalo for a good portion of his teen years, if that explains anything.*

*I spent most of my life just trying to avoid the two of them. Hard to do without doors sometimes. I can list our literally hundreds of instances where we were all shitty human beings to each other and those around us. As of typing this, the two of them have had a fight where my younger was knocked unconscious, and beaten, sustaining a possible permanent injury to one of his ankles. I do not know if they'll ever speak again. And I've told both that I don't want to be a part of their shit.*

*When we were older, things got better. But all three of us have always been belligerant about whats been done in the past, and none of us really get along well for long periods of time. A few hours is usually my threshold before I need to be away from them. They can occasionally be good company, but, mostly not.*

*I think that's enough text for this one. I will say, I do not have faith in myself. I do not believe in myself. If I did, I would have done a lot more than I have. I wouldn't be failing every time I make an attempt to find some kind of happiness.*",1
"I was a quiet weird child who couldn't talk to other kids. My friends were just bullies who abused my kindness and lack of courage. I spent my childhood online because everything was nicer and funner there. So of course i have no friends now and I dont know how to interact with people normally. Being truly alone is more painful and impactful than imaginable for most. I am now bitter and fed up with myself and everyone. I don't enjoy anything anymore, I cant do anything at all without feeling terrible. I cant think anymore my mind is blank I want to take a sledge hammer to my head just to see what's in there. Thatd be stupid though. I don't see a future for myself. I wish it didn't all happen like this, I feel like I never had a chance. abused in childhood never loved by anyone and jealous of everyone who isn't grateful that they're loved and appreciated. My mind is gone, any chances I had are gone at this point, socially I will never be successful and so what's the point? Youre depressed yeah just tell your friends and family they love you and want you happy! My family wont help me I dont have the means to help myself. My brain is fucking mush. What a world huh

I dont know if I mean most of this but Im not feeling good so dont take it too seriously",1
"I have been taking Sertraline for 9 months and was on max dosage and after 3 months everything got better. My mindset changed and I looked back at myself and couldnât believe the thoughts I had and was scared how bad I was.

Thinking I was fine, I reduce my dosage and Iâve stop taking them but the withdrawals are not what I expected.

I read about others but I didnât truly understand how intense they are, my mindset is going back to what is was, I slept 2 hours maximum a night, I have constant brain zaps, sweats.

I havenât gone back on the antidepressant yet because Iâve gone a week without them but I was wondering if I should hold this out? Will it get worse and how long do I have. 

I didnât have a problem taking the meds but (and I know this sounds bad) but in my own mind they were a crutch. When I felt better I just wanted to leave that part of my life behind and remembering to take them pulls me back into that headspace 

Is the negative thoughts and anxiety part of the withdrawal symptoms or is it me slipping back into my old way of thinking",3
"Iâm tired of worrying my friends and loved ones by posting things where they can see them so I just made this account to talk here. Talk of self harm to follow, sorry. Also itâs kind of my life story lol.

I started thinking about killing or hurting myself in high school- the summer between freshman and sophomore year I just took a fucking nosedive. I totally retreated into my head, cut off every friend I had made my first year besides literally two. I took an exacto knife from art class and started cutting my hips (because no one would see them there.) The only person who saw was my best friend while I was changing at her house. Sheâs not someone who shows a lot of emotion, but Iâd never heard her gasp like that or seen her as shocked and hurt as I did right then. To this day, sheâs the only person who knows I do that. (Also, somehow, she was willing to date me and we are still together 7 years later.) 

I barely passed high school (I think the only reason I didnât go to summer school is because they literally forgot about me.) I remember once admitting to the guidance counselor I hurt myself, and it was a huge force of effort for me to admit that. All she said was âThatâs not good,â and I never saw her again. I have no idea why I told her and not the actual therapist I was seeing at the time. The therapist might have done something. 

Then I tried college. I somehow go into a decent art school. My freshman year was absolutely fucking miserable. No friends (well, one, but we never did anything besides hang out in our rooms), horrible roommate, tanking grades. I just stopped showing up to class at one point near the end of the year because I knew it was pointless. The small scholarship I had somehow managed to get (which I think was just a result of me coming from an inner city school) was taken away within the first semester. I had just thought I might not have been able to do traditional school, but maybe I would do well in art school. Clearly, I was wrong. Obviously I dropped out. I told my parents I was taking a gap year but...lol. We all knew it was a lie. Three years later and I have zero plans to go to any college at all. 

I constantly make jokes about me dropping out around my friends and parents. Iâve always done that; deflecting my pain with humor. I guess I think if I joke about it enough itâll stop hurting so much. Whatâs even harder is I am still close friends with my one college friend- and they are graduating in a few months from what I view as my biggest failure. 

All my friends are going to college and doing well. My girlfriend is getting an accelerated masterâs degree. Sheâs very school smart and has always done very well. Iâm going with her to a networking party in a month or so as her plus one- Iâm going to support her but Iâm afraid Iâm just going to start crying being surrounded by all these successful people because I know I will never be that. Iâm so scared Iâm going to drag her down for the rest of her life. Sheâs so smart and driven and is going to be very successful and I am going to work a shitty retail job like I have now for the rest of my life. I know she loves me but every time she tries to compliment me and tell me that I have value I just get angry because I feel like sheâs just saying that. My brain shuts down when people try to talk to me about my future because I can barely picture myself being alive tomorrow, let alone in a few years. 

I never cut every day, just when I was feeling intense emotional pain that needed to be let out somehow. Iâve never made it a full year without doing it- but some years Iâve gone 6 or 7 months without. But lately Iâve been thinking about it constantly. I just keep a knife in my room now for easy access. I had a party with several friends last week. After they all left, I felt lower than I had in months. It was Christmas Eve, and I was just lying in bed sobbing and bleeding from my hips. I have several plans for events and trips in january- and yet I canât get excited for them or feel anything at all. I feel like things are going to get very bad for me (even worse than they have been) very soon. And the worst part is that itâs almost a comforting thought.

I can't take it anymore ,3
"I just spent new years eve alone on a rooftop. I really didn't want to celebrate this night with other people so I ignored every invitation and ran off before any neighbors could inivite me... But I still want wish everyone of you a good year. Nobody bothered to call or message me but I still have this sub. 

Things may not be any better just because another 24 hours passed, but to everyone who also spends the night alone: I wish you a great year and good luck for the things you're going to attempt!",2
"I made another post here before but I deleted it out of nervousness. This'll be my second one. Hope it's okay.

I have felt the worst pain ever due to hating my body. It is a great weight that just burdens me every day. I make it part of my life to protect other people from the repulsiveness. I don't wear anything that's supposed to compliment my body, because quite frankly, it just does the opposite. I could go into so much detail about everything. I hate my face and I hate my body. It is this horrible weight, this impending shame. The only thing I can describe it as is...shame. Horrible, horrible shame. 

I don't even hate my body, I hate what I did to it. I hate myself for abusing my body. It works so hard to keep me alive and I've destroyed it. I hate sitting down because then I feel the fat. I hate feeling my stomach touch my shirt because it reminds me that it protrudes even when I suck it in. I hate that my body's imbalanced, because of course, I was blessed with the small boobs that ABSOLUTELY NO ONE in my family has but me. I'm 50 pounds overweight and I have absolutely nothing. My doctor tells me it's okay (despite the BMI saying I'm obese). She tells me that I'm still in a safe range. My heart isn't in danger and nor is my body. That's a relief, but I still don't feel good.

I feel it's my duty to protect the world from my appearance. I don't want to subject anyone to what I have to see. I know people say that other people aren't looking and don't care, but that doesn't matter to me. I would never want myself looking like how I do in public. I don't wear anything that hugs my body. Some take it as ""modest"", and while I do aim to be modest, it's not because of that. I hate moving and getting out of bed and just talking because of it. I just want to hide from the world and stay in a box of shame and guilt. I hate feeling my stomach exist. I hate my stomach protruding. I hate how clothes cut my body fat in half. I call it the 3 phenomenon because it looks like the shape of 3 from a side view. That's the worst feeling to me. That's what always reminds me. I hate going outside and going into public because of it. I hate looking into the mirror. All I see is a ""sack of pig's flesh"", as I've named it. That phrase seems to be the only one that really captures the repulsiveness, disgust, and shame I feel.

I've dreamed of throwing up multiple times. But I know the dangers. I know it destroys your esophagus permanently. But I still want to fix it. I haven't done anything though. I may never do anything about it, regarding dangerous and reckless actions like throwing up. I know it won't ever be truly fixed, because as soon as I get skinny, then I won't have any good attributes. I don't know how I'll ever find a partner without anything appealing or pretty, because I've already cut the pool down to nearly nothing by waiting till marriage and being cyberschooled/being an absolute hermit. Not to mention also being a huge bitch.

I have tried so many times and I give up because I have no self control. I really think I need to be babysat on my diet. I need someone to keep an eye on me till I'm normal, and then get training to help keep a good lifestyle. I have no willpower. All I have is fear and sadness. Even that doesn't motivate me. I have no energy to be motivated. I've disappointed myself so much. I am a disappointment. I am a failure in so many regards and I am so mad at myself for everything. I live in shame. I have to constantly stare at this ugly sack of pig's flesh. It's caused me so much sadness. I don't want to do anything anymore because it just fills me with sadness adn shame. I don't want to stop existing. I just want to hide. Hide so others don't have to see it. No one has told me my body's beautiful. People just say ""you're not fat"" and I know damn right they're lying. They do that after I start whining and crying. Only then will they reassure me, and I know that's to shut me up. No one has ever actually told me I'm appealing. People have only told me my face is beautiful when I have makeup on. Once boys see me without makeup they stop talking to me (But that may also be cause I'm overbearing and kinda weird).

I don't even know if I should post this. I may actually delete this. Sorry if it's too long. Also, sorry if it sounds narcissistic or vain. I'm not looking for compliments. I just needed to say this.",1
"I just got to thinking about how much time I spend alone. Throughout elementary and middle school I had some friends that I hung out with. I lost them all when I went to high school, where I was forced to make new friends. None of those friendships stuck though, and I never hung out with any of the people I talked to. Imagine that: four years of going to school and coming home and spending all that time by yourself. I got to wondering tonight what that does to a personâs psycheâ¦ I like to think I introspect a lot and Iâm a thoughtful person because of it, but I think the more likely outcome of all this is that iâve become socially awkward, paranoid, and bitter towards the people around me. Iâm like a social and societal disease. Every room I walk into itâs like Iâm sucking all the energy from everyone there. Itâs like that in college too. I just started last semester and Iâve made no friends. i know people in my dorm or in my classes think of me as as that girl with no friends. They either pity me or ignore me like the plague. Sorry for the weird rant. Just wondering if anyone else feels like thisâ¦",1
"It's all like:

Do things now don't wait
Don't please people
Don't be lazy
Don't waste time

Well fuck I can't do any of that so I guess that means I'll never be successful so fuck that I should just kill myself and avoid the disappointment",2
"Iâve been having lucid dreams due to the side effects of my meds and Iâm finding it hard to cope with them. I talked to my doctor and he told me to try taking them in the morning instead of at night but that hasnât really helped.

I also asked him for sleeping pills and they didnât help either. In fact, they made things worse as I woke up right after from a nightmare and I found myself grabbing onto the bedsheets like I was grabbing onto something from my dream. I donât remember what it was but it was the first and last time I took them.

Going to sleep is no longer the comfort it once was. Even though I get plenty of sleep I wake up feeling mentally drained, and because these lucid dreams make it seems like I was awake and dealing with real life situations that tend to be stressful and unpleasant itâs like I wasnât really asleep. Physically Iâm well rested but mentally Iâm not. Idk if that makes sense but I feel like Iâm going crazy because in my dreams I sometimes âwake upâ and think everything is normal but then previous events from the dream come back and itâs so confusing. Then when I really wake up it takes me a minute to actually realize it was all just a dream and itâs messed up. 

I told my doc and he said most of the antidepressants have similar side effects and thatâs kinda made me miserable. I donât wanna trade my sanity just to stop being depressed. Iâm honestly thinking about stopping meds again. Idk anymore. ",1
It all started in fifth grade.. It was there I realized what was loneliness and being an outcast. I feel like an outcast honestly everywhere and I feel like garbage of who I am. From 5th grade to (currently)10th grade I have been becoming more and more depressed. At first it just started as sadness from time to time but around 9th grade it really kicked into overdrive. Its gotten to the point where I don't truly laugh anymore or anything not even my own family make me genuinely happy. To make matters worse I probably don't have it as bad as some people here but idk why I can't get that through my head...anyways have a happy new years everyone.. Heres to another year of depression lol. ,1
"For the past 5 years my New Year's Eves have been nightmares. Each year I get my hopes up to do something fun and I am disappointed. Last year my boyfriend at the time promised me we would plan an awesome New Years in the city. I almost cried I was so happy and excited because I loved him so much, I would get to be that person that got to dress up and have fun and be happy. Wrong. 
He broke up with me Christmas night. Then the next day my grandfather died. Then the whole year sucked after that. Then one of my favorite cats in the world passed away. That hit me hard. Don't judge. 

Now here I am, alone in bed, crying, watching everyone else have fun. I wasn't invited to a single thing by a single person. 

My ex that I'm still in love with has had a new girlfriend for months, that he dotes on and praises and is so happy with. I know they'll post pictures together tomorrow of their New Years together - something I so desperately wanted and never got. He hasn't spoken to me since he met her. Proving I was just worthless shit and she is a complete upgrade that he is happy with.  He doesn't care what happened to me. He got what he wanted - her - he's happy, he's forgotten me. 
And I don't want to hear any tired cliches of ""he's a douche, you have value"",  blah blah. He was only a douche to me because I wasn't what he wanted. He's a perfect boyfriend to the new girl - who is prettier and more fun and more successful than me. I don't mean shit to him, I wasn't good enough for him to put effort into. But she is. And now she's getting everything I wanted.

My friends have forgotten me.
My family doesn't care.
I'm a loser with a shit retail job, can't get a single job with my degree. 
All I have is my cat. 

Taking a handful of sedatives so I can be unconscious as long as possible. I'm not trying to overdose but if it kills me then fine. 

I fucking hate New Years. ",2
"He has depression. He told me that he lost someone important to him and he's been feeling emotionless since. This person apparently passed away without warning and it was within the last month.

We were somewhat dating and I noticed he pulled away, which I thought was him ghosting, but he said he was ready for a relationship with me before this happened. I'm not sure what to do now... or what to say to his messages explaining this.

Any advice? Should I offer to see him in person or do you think he doesn't want anything to do with me right now? As an fyi, I've never been to his house and don't know where he lives specifically so that's not an option. ",3
"I have improved my life significantly over the past two years: I found an antidepressant that works for me, I've gone back to school, I've got a steady job, I've even gone on a few dates, and I adopted a dog to give me a place to focus my attention and love on. 

I thought that if I could improve myself, or at least improve my situation, that it would feel better, and in some ways i guess it does.

The depression is still there though. It's not as constant ,and in fact as long as I'm around someone, my friends, my family, or even my dog, I feel alright. But it never really goes away. Sometimes I'm watching a movie, or listening to a song, or taking too long to go to sleep it hits me.

In these moments I remember that I'm a useless waste of life. All of my accomplishments are stripped away to reveal the fact that I'm just a bunch of nothing. In time it goes away but it's never too long before I revisit those feelings.

Is it the same for anyone else? Can you truly ever ""get over"" depression?",3
"I might sound like a total nutjob but hear me out. 

Most of the time I start daydreaming and fantasizing about actually having friends (as if) and an interesting life, like in a cartoon adventure or something. Sometimes I even make up scenarios in my head with real life people about things that could've happened. 

It's starting to become more and more frequent and I'm finding myself moving my lips to the conversations in my head. Then reality comes crashing down and it feels horrible when I realize my crazy fantasies will never happen. 

It's just so much better in my mind. Anyone else?",1
"I thought I was doing better, so I cut down on my antidepressants, like, in the spring. I was doing alright when university work wasn't so difficult. 

Then I had two pieces of coursework, one due in a week after the other, just before Christmas break. I couldn't meet the deadlines. I got a two week extension for both, meaning my final deadline ended a week into my Christmas break.

Now I have an exam on Wendsday, another on Friday and another the following Monday. I haven't been able to revise. I can't revise. I can't focus. When I try, I keep telling myself it's pointless. It was a mistake to try and go to university. It was a mistake to try and be successful or happy. I'm just going to be what I always have been, a pathetic, useless waste of space.

I'm going to fail these exams. It will be confirmation that I should never have hoped that I could be more than I am. Then what? I try and retake, when I'm busy with other exams? I don't know.

Why did I reduce my tablets? Because I was doing better? Because I felt I didn't need them? Because I actually thought I was actually strong enough to deal with my problems? And now I suffer the penalty for daring to think I could ever be ""better.""",2

"I don't want to live this way anymore, when I say that I mean i'm mentally and physically exhausted with life and it's repetitive nature. Work a job you don't want to work for 50+ years, hopefully have a 401k or some sort of savings and die? is that really all there is to life? Seems like suck a depressing reality and that's all I think about on a constant basis, This is the root of my depression.

1 month ago I was considering suicide.  I talked to my primary care physician and told them how I was feeling and what I was thinking.  They put me into a group therapy program and I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder.  I can honestly say it saved my life.  I cannot express how helpful this was for me and I urge you all to talk to someone.  There is hope for us all and people willing to listen.  Itâs the new year and the perfect time for a change.  ,3
"So i'm visiting another city with my friends, i knew upfront most of them would be couples and us single folks would be in minority, but what the hell, right? And at first, it went along well but now, two days in and i'm getting that feeling, like two people are making out violently next to you? Yeah, kinda like that. I also overhead someone say ""but anon is the only single person here, which i didn't really want spelled out to everyone. 

The only thing i'm thinking of right now is this and if maybe there's a bus that leaves for my city soon and jump on it without telling anyone. 

So i don't want to do now, other than eat and drink myself to sleep, with the others. I'm not bitching that ""waah, give gf now, waah"", it's just that I don't like being made fun of for this reason. So what, i'm single, i'm socially inept, and i'm depressed. That's me. ",1
"So, I have really bad emetophobia. That means I have a fear of vomit. Â I have horrible dreams about vomit every night. Last night I had the worst vomit dream yet about my brother vomiting and it was so traumatic that it is really sticking with me today, I couldn't shake the horrible feelings. I found out after I woke up that he is actually sick and has been vomiting. But I have to go to an orchestra thing with him and my family tonight. I was obviously worried about it and my mom got upset about it and told me not to ruin the family's day. I really didn't know what to do because I had been on the edge of crying all day. I feel like my family thinks I am selfish forÂ  expressing my anxiety about this and I feel shame. At the concert it was fine and I was coping. But after the concert, my brother said he felt sick and thaf made me really anxious. I kept walking so I was away from him, preferably ahead. We went down a bunch of stairs and my anxiety grew. We went in an open area and I was so terrified that I would see him do the thing that I started to tear up. By the time we got outside I was crying silently to myself. The whole way to the car I was behind everybody so nobody knew I was crying harder and harder thinking about what I could do to avoid getting in a car with him, but thinking that my parents would get mad and think I'm ridiculous. When we got there we were about to get in an elevator and I was hyperventilating to the point that they looked. They went up the elevator and Mystica came with me while I almost collapsed on the stairwell. I literally was gasping so much I couldn't breathe. My mom came down the stairs and asked me if this was because I thought Michael would vom. I said yes. She said I need to pull my act together, that she doesn't want me to ruin their night,Â  she wanted it to be a happy night. She told me that he hasn't vomited yet so I shouldn't be like this. She said I need to pull it together. This was all in a raised voice and I could tell she was mad. 

This hurt me and invalidated me so, so much. I stared blankly the ride home and then I texted her pouring my heart out about how hurt I am. She still didn't really seem to care. 

I'm honestly a little bit surprised because I didn't think it was possible to feel so fucking isolated. I didn't think she would do something this bad. I left and slept at somebody else's house. I feel so horrible and worthless.

"So Iâm pretty much just gliding through the days now. I mean, the entire day just passes by and I have no sense or awareness of the time. It seems like before I know it itâs 5am and time to repeat it over and over again. This has gone on for the past 7 months and has gotten progressively worse over time. 

Iâm not really sure what to do. My financial situation calls for me to stay at home with my two young kids while my fiancÃ© works so most days Iâm just trapped in here staring at the same four walls. My fiancÃ© doesnât understand me when I tell him that everything seems dull and grey. I know I sound like a whiny, sad sack of shit but I feel like Iâm legitimately on the verge of a mental breakdown. 

Is there anyone else in here whoâs gone through this who is also a parent? Or just anyone whoâs gone through this at all? It feels like Iâve lost my identity. I keep trying to remember things that I liked to do before I became a parent but I come up blank. Iâve even lost the ability to have normal social interactions. Like, I used to be very outgoing and pretty talkative but now it seems like when Iâm at a social gathering I canât find anything to talk about for the life of me. Then I end up just coming across really weird and desperate and socially awkward. Iâm tired of everyone telling me âthatâs the mom life and you just have to suck it upâ. It doesnât feel like every other mom or parent is feeling this way. I feel like Iâm drowning.

Tl;dr- Iâm a parent on the verge of a mental breakdown and I donât know how to pull myself out of it

Tonight I got hypothermia and frostbite on my left foot at work because I donât want to admit I have inabilities in the cold because of the lupus (I have neuropathy and vascular issues). Iâm in so much pain tonight and donât know what to do. I hate being in so much pain. I just donât have anyone to talk to about this and donât want to introduce it to anyone.

"I saw this tumblr post going around the internet telling people to start the new year going to bed early and waking up refreshed, and I thought hell yes that sounds really nice, I should do that. Cause I'm superstitious and I always have this feeling at the back of my mind that however I start the year is going to be a premonition of how the rest of the year is going to be. For the past several years I've started the year either depressed, literally on the verge of suicide, or high as fuck, and the rest of the year always mirrored that, proving my paranoia right. So I said this year is going to be different. But it's 4:45am on jan 1st now and I'm drunk as hell because I ran out of weed so I couldn't sleep and now I'm suicidal as well and I can't help but feeling like 2018 is going to be a whole other year of drugs and booze and depression and it's like, what's the point? Why don't I just end it now?

I feel like I was doing everything right, and that I've been wronged, but I don't feel like a snowflake. I feel the exact opposite. I am  going in tomorrow to work at mcdonalds while I try to get a job over at the niche mom and pop restaurant near my house. I have job experience and I'm not unemployed, thank god for that, but I'm just feeling depressed and reminiscing about my past and what I could've changed about it, although, there was little room for it. Sometimes it makes me feel liberated feeling like I regret nothing for having dealt with and going to deal with rough shit, but the feeling remains that nobody will ever take me seriously and I fucked up.

"Hello there.

First of all, this isn't an 'emergency' or something, I'm not suicidal and I know I'll get over this depression, but maybe somebody can help make it quicker.

I'm a 27 year old male and about 5 months ago I lost the parent who raised me. I was fat most of my life, except for a few years when I was a teen. I'm 5'10 (178cm) and 285 pounds (130kg) atm, I'm really unhappy with my body and my voice. I'm not handsome by any standard and I'm poor too (and I'm getting bald).

Recently I fell in love for a girl but she lives in US and she's smart and beautiful, I'm from western Europe and I don't have the money to go to US. If I had the means to go I'd surely at least try even though I know I'd probably be rejected (like, 99.9% of chance). I have a lot of responsibilities here too. I'm losing weight but it's probably going to take a few months/years to reach my ideal and even when that happens I guess I'll have loose skin. The fact is: I wouldn't want to date someone like me, how can I expect others to? Please don't come up with that acceptance thing, although I really appreciate the good intentions I just can't change what my brain finds attractive or not.

I've never been with a girl I loved ( or not :P ), I've only loved 3 girls so far, one when I was 17 and I was slim and such, but I didn't have the balls to express my feelings. Then again when I was I guess 20 or something, I wasn't very obese so I was somewhat OK with my weight, but the girls was from Australia and we didn't even have the time to know each other better.

People keep saying that's a 'crush' or something, but that's a start isn't it? I mean, I don't feel like approaching girls I don't feel something strong for and I totally don't believe 'real long-lasting love' will emerge from a forced relationship. A girl once wanted to approach me (but I was in love with that 2nd girl) so I suppose I'm not unbearably ugly but I certainly can't compete with the other guys in terms of looks.

I've been working my 'bottom' off for some time now, and I hope to make some money to be financially comfortable, but I don't want a girl to like me because of that, while I surely plan to use some of the money to improve myself.

I like smart girls with strong political opinions and definitely I don't like 'good' girls that are OK with everything and always trying to avoid conflicts. This girls I'm in love with really seems the perfect match, I honestly never been so sure about that, but I simply can't have her.

So, this is the situation I'm facing at the moment, my heart aches so much but I don't express it to others. I don't have anyone to talk about that only my dog and although that helps a bit it doesn't count much.

I'm trying to focus on my work to forget her but I can't. Everything I see feels familiar in a way that reminds her, this is something I never felt before, even looking at this text somehow I remind her face. Maybe there's a hormonal imbalance or something. I'm certainly not discarding the possibility of a physiological effect.

So, sorry for the big text and thank you for reading it. I'd really appreciate any advice on that. Thank you very much.

"I know a lot have been discussed about SSRI and their potential sexual side effects. For the last 6 months I have been on Fluoxetine and Duloxetine (my shrink thinks that my depression is a result of bad things that happened to me and was planning to wean and stop them within 1 year). However, I had to take a drug screen for work and I read that Fluoxetine can give a false positive result in the UDS and I didn't want to tell my potential employer that and take anti - depressants for the fear of stigmatizing. Anyway, I stopped both SSRIs 1 week before the test (now is 10 days without them) and I don't feel any different, in fact if anything, I feel happier, but the most striking was my marked increase in my libido and the capability to ejaculate once again :) When I was on the SSRIs I had turned into an asexual creature and if I ""force"" my self to have sex or watch porn I had a half - @ass erection and (kind of whiskey d!ck) and more often than not I had to fake and orgasm (using a condom) or if by any chance I can finish is after a long ""banging"" and with an almost painful spasms of my legs, really weird sense. Now I feel like I am a 30 yr old (I am mid - 40s) - have a ""morning wood"", I regained my interest in sex, I am able to ejaculate, etc. I am nervous to start the meds again, but don't want to go back to the deep depression that I was before in case they had any effect.

"I started the new year drunk and now first time high. And you know what? I'm going to still be depressed as fucking ever this year and I'm betting if I keep this up I'm going to kill myself this year. A new year doesn't mean anything just more time to explore depressed, more time to hate yourself and I might just be so fucking gone this morning to think straight but honestly I don't want anything to happen this year except me killing myself because there's no fucking point anymore. I'd rather just fucking off myself and end this year without anymore fucking suffering",3
"The company i work for is in a moving process so many departements are left vacant or just stuff that isnt picked up yet to the new location. Wich typically means fridges with plenty of old food in it and beer, and i had to work christmas and i allready went through a difficult time and i am still doing it. I just got some bright idea that all the beer around the building werent going to be missed so i took some of it (4 cans all in different departments...) thinking that it wouldnt be missed since they have allready left... And i felt somekind of Â«fuck you mentalityÂ» too them since they were the ones that put me on this shift and never give anything in return... i drank the beers when i got home and dissolved further into my missery till my mom had to throw me into the ER a few days later. Now on sick leave and just got home, i have felt a big regret for stealing the beer... Fuck... I cannot grasp why i even had the thought of doing this and i dont know what to do if they find out!!!  Its just some cheap beer i could easily buy for 10 bucks and now my job can be on the line because of this... idk what to do!!! I feel so ashamed!!! It`s not the first time doing something really stupid while depressed but this is just a small inane stupid thing i did wich can have big consequences for my stupid shitty life.. i cant bear it and its making it all worse!!!

"I guess I'm looking for 3rd party opinions and maybe a little support if anyone else is in the same predicament. TMS has been the only thing to work for me, but its efficacy might be fleeting and insurance doesn't approve maintenance. I had a late response to the initial TMS series and they denied me for 10 more sessions; I wrote them a fairly scathing appeal letter and ended up winning; I used to be a writer at least in mind. I never had any accolades but I liked what I wrote and wrote a lot. So I let them have it in the letter and got the 10 extra sessions but everything is still uncertain long term.

So now my doctor drops the bomb that after this, ECT is pretty much where we go from here if the TMS doesn't hold. I'm 25, and I'm worried both about destroying my brain with treatment as well as allowing this disorder to keep me from really doing or acheiving anything in what will amount to a short, unnecessarily painful life. 

Is there another place people go from here? Do you just get real into Buddhism or stoicism or some shit and white-knuckle it? I always feel like there's something I have to be missing, and yet... 

I almost feel bad relating my story at this stage, as I'm pretty sure I'm doing all the things one is supposed to do, and yet recovery feels as remote as ever. Even with ECT it's like, what's the fucking point, probably fry my brain for a 60% chance at remission, that may not hold either. In fact, some of the studies I'm reading say that I may even be less likely to experience remission from ECT based on my absent response to medications as well as the length of my episode. 

I thought I didn't have much to say but I guess I did. ",3

I can't do anything right anymore. My girl and I have been fighting financial struggle for about 7 months now. Our cars broke down in two separate locations and even though the businesses promised they woildnt tow them they did. Now it will cost 700 to get our cars back which we dont have and cant get. We are not going to have rent and our roomates are going to kick us out. We thought things were just about to get better with both getting new jobs. But then this shit happens. I cant do it anymore and I know she can't. I'm supposed to be the one who can help her get through tough times but I'm losing the fight inside of me. I just want to die. I really do.,2
"4 am, can't sleep, as always. I really need to get this out of my chest. I apologize for the long text, but I really need some advice. My life is s complete mess atm and I don't know what to do.

Long story short, I'm 20 years old uninteresting guy, whose future has no purpose at all. I've never had a girlfriend, I'm studying a degree I don't like all and I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks, with minimal chances for getting better.

It all started when I was 15. I went to the hospital because I thought I was having some sort of heart attack. After many cardiac exams, I was later diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder. Although, the fear of dying still haunts me constantly. 

 Due to this fact and some other conditions, my grades started  gradually decreasing. At the moment, I'm at the 3rd year of my graduation, studying retail management at a small university. I hate the subjects I'm studying. Every time I wake up and think about needing to the classes, I get more and more demotivated. Needless to say I already failed several subjects and my grades are shit. I can't see myself doing this professionally, but it's too late to give up now, my parents paid for 3 years of studying and I can't disappoint them and waste their money completely. Back in days, I really like Informatics Engineering and Psychology, but due to my awful high school performance, my grades weren't high enough to ingress in any of these graduations. 

My only interests now are music, sports betting, writing, photography and videogames, but there's no real way I could make money and live on that. My self-esteem is as low as it can be, no girl seems to find interest in me. I might be really ugly or I lack some serious social skills. I can count my friends with a single hand, and we usually spend most of the times playing videogames, so I don't go out that much. I find to make a good first impression sometimes, but then I always screw everything up. The only things keeping me on track are drinking, smoking, gambling and occasionally doing drugs.

I wish I had the guts to pack my things up and start a new life somewhere else, but I'm a coward. Every day is a fucking nightmare, I feel slowly getting  physically sick, depressed and more hopeless as the time goes by. I can't stand myself and my life, but I lack the power, energy and motivation to change it.",2
and things get really bad so that i can finally kill myself. I'm so sick of not able to kill myself because there is always this voice saying it's not that bad and not having enough courage because things are not that bad. There is no point anymore in trying so hard every year when nothing gets better. I'm so tired of living like this and waiting for nothing.  And happy new year to everyone with mental illness and i hope this year turn out to be great for you all.,3
"What is even the point? Walks are boring, I hate shopping, and I have no clue or ability to socialize on my own with new people.

"Iâve always had depression, and itâs gotten really bad this year. Itâs affecting every aspect of my life, Iâve pushed most of my friends away, barely been talking to my family, my finances are a mess, and worst of all, my performance at work has gotten really bad. My boss is very hands off, so no one knew how behind I had gotten, what a mess Iâd made of my work. Well last week I got a kidney stone and had to be out several days, and when I was gone they discovered how bad I was doing. Ugh.   
   
Now, Tuesday first thing in the morning I have a meeting with my boss and HER boss called âdiscussion about performanceâ and I think itâs extremely likely I get fired. Even though I find it REALLY hard to talk about, Iâm considering just being totally honest and talking to them about my depression, and how much itâs eacallated this year. Let them know that itâs not just my work that has suffered, but my finances, soicial life, family life, health, everything. Iâm not trying to use it as an excuse, itâs just the truth. I donât know that it will save my job, but at this point I donât know what else to do.   
   
Has anyone ever done this. What do you think? Any advice? Iâm so scared of losing my job and just spiraling further and further down.",2
"I have severe PTSD, brought on by events that happened to me in the military.

I have an eating disorder, body dysmorphia, and Asperger's too.


I also have zero support group.  I have a therapist I see when he has an opening for me (shitty insurance), and that's about it.

I live with a 60 year old male room-mate who has 5 cats and 2 fish tanks and refuses to take care of them after promising he would.  He also likes to watch porn and ... yeah ... in the living room.  He refuses to understand even a fraction of what it's like to live with the shit in my head.  I'm constantly being asked ""why do you get so mad?"" His other favorite thing to say is ""stop using your PTSD as an excuse.""  What the fuck?  An excuse?  I have never used *anything* as an excuse in my entire fucking life, you asshole.

I have no friends.  I have no family.  I am fucking isolated where I am, and with no way out.  I've got 5k in debt I'm trying to get paid off, and I'm on SSDI, so I can't afford a place of my own.  I also have a piece of shit Jeep that needs serious mechanical work.

I just .... I'm struggling, you know?  I'm fucking struggling, and I thought being on Reddit and writing for a certain community would get this shit out of my head but it hasn't.  I've got more people that hate me than like me.  I can't seem to do *anything* right.  You'd think at my age I'd have my shit together, but I fucking don't.  No matter how hard I try, I fuck up.

"I posted on suicide a couple of minutes ago. I really dont know i am gonna kill myself but surely not today, theres an overwhelming feeling of numbness inside me and i feel like i am nothing really.
I take medication for depression over 16 years now. Five years ago i started taking meds also for anxiety. I have an eating disorder for also nearly 16 years. I feel low and like if i was completely worthless.
I have conquered many battles in my life, sexual abuse by relative and school peers, drug addiction and acute self harming. Ive had awful relationships where i guess i was trying to fill the emotional void my father left inside my soul. The father of my child was abusive and an alcoholic and a drug addict. He got over his issues and is really a changed man and we get along fine. I still feel bad for not making us work or succeed. Like many things in my life, it was a huge failure. Ive tried practically everything to feel better, excersise, therapy, talking with friends etc, but now i have hit a low point in my life and i dont know really if i can recover.
I started a new relationship almost a year ago, i am in love with this man and i suffer every day. He is perfect, professional and amazing. He is bit older than me. He is cold and hot with me every month and shuts me down every now and then. Ive done everything to make it work but he has left me again and now for good. I cant believe its over. I gave my heart and soul to this relationship and now its done. I loved him and gave him everything he needed. Now he hates me and has blocked me from everything while i beg for him to come back. One week ago he told me he loved me and gave me a beautiful ring, now im devastated and alone.
I take care of my mother and child. I have a decent job and no financial worries atm.
I feel like the worst mother on earth, like scum and i really want to die at moments and have attempted numerous times. 
I feel lost and that everyone would be better off without me. I look at the subway rails and think if i will have the courage, i cut from time to time and beg to have the courage to press down hugely on to the blade, stand infront of avenues and think of jumping infront of a bus...
I feel like giving up and that everything i have tried and fought for has been worthless, like me, cos in reality im just a piece of shit.
I really dont know what to do...

I'm a slow learner and went into college, very innocent and naive from a strict household. I tried to get laid but couldn't. College is easy for sex but I was struggling. I hate being a virgin. Now that college is done, I regret it and my wasted youth.

I'm slowly losing my sanity and I've had enough of being clueless. I don't know where to start I'm not getting any younger. I went from optimistic to very depressed, self hating, isolated.

Been going through abuse from my parents since 2, been depressed and numb for 20 years and bullying, I never had any friends, I got in an accident and permanently deformed. it got really bad the last 2 years, I had an autoimmune disorder. I don't want therapy, I can't afford it.

I'm in 40k debt with a shit grade. I've never been allowed to have fun or play anything, I can't live my own life. It's all wasted. I'm going to end it soon.

"I am currently in my friend's restroom breaking down for the last ~30 minutes. Aplogies for the wall of text.

In the eyes of many, I am sure my life is fine. I am moderately attractive with a relatively outgoing personality and decent intelligence. I get lucky with some thing and have the best friend group someone could ask for. Yet despite all this, I still am overwhelemed with depression. To preface, my depression is sometimes caused by outlying causes, but mostly seems to manifest randomly whenever it wants to.

I graduated in 2010 with high expectations from my folks. Nothing too crazy, but significantly better than I performed. With depression and anxiety, I have skipped on many of the opportunities in life (fun, women, careers, etc) and can't seem to truly overcome it entirely. I trick myself into believing it is gone for periods of time, but it inevitably comes back harder than the times previous. I now am sitting in 2018 having accomplished little outside of making a good friend group, and while having gone into business with a close friend, feel like I am the weak partner.

Ultimately my whole life feels like I squandered it and wasted myself when others could've capitalized and lived a happy, fruitful life while my depression and anxiety rules who I am to this day. Frankly, I don't feel deserving of the opportunities I have recieved, regardless of any good I have done. I know it's stupid for someone in my situation to feel this way with so much good in life compared to most others in this subreddit and elsewhere, so i'm sorry.

Hope you all have a good year.",2
I am worthless. I am a nerd. I think like a nerd. I act like a nerd. But I'm not as smart as a nerd. I am too poor to collect comics. My brain isn't wired to learn programming. I haven't seen any nerdy shows. My only strength is math. But that's not that nerdy. I have alienated myself. It's too late for me.,2

"I have been struggling with depression for the past 4 years. I am a freshman in college and am currently the happiest I have been in an extremely long time. I have been dating my girlfriend for 2 months now and I have built many strong friendships at school. I felt like I was finally ready to tell my dad about what I'm going through and why high school was so hrs for me and why it has been nearly impossible for me to mend our relationship.

I believe that one of the leading causes of my depression is the family environment that I spent my high school years in. My dad worked two full time jobs because he wanted to leave corporate America so he started a business. Every day he would come home around 10 extremely stressed and irritable. Because him and my mom wanted the best for me they were extremely strict with their expectations grades. Every night would be screaming while I stared at them blankly telling them what they wanted to hear.

When I think back to 8th grade through junior year, it's nearly impossible to remember anything but yelling. I was scared to tell them that I was depressed because my mom is extremely protective and caring and sweet and she would do everything in her power to help me. But I don't want their help. I've stopped cutting and thoughts of suicide are few and far between.

A couple weeks ago I found out that one of my good friends tried to kill themselves. When I was talking to my dad about it he said that he just didn't understand depression and how someone could have depression but nothing to be depressed about. This made me want to share my thoughts and feelings with him even less.

Something my dad shared with me is what completely changed my outlook on everything . He shared with me that his greatest fear in life was losing his connection with me and our relationship completely withering away. I believed that the only way I could get better is if I shared with him what is going on.

After telling him about my depression a few days ago he told me that if my mom found out she definitely would not let me go back to school so she could keep an eye on me. So I'm not sure what to do with this situation. 

I'm sorry if this post doesn't belong here. I just needed to release everything from my mind and write it down somewhere someone could hopefully see it. Other than my girlfriend I have no one to share with. Thank you for reading.",2

"This is my little story. 

2017 was one of the hardest years of my life. I rang in the New Year drunk and drugged out at a music festival in hope that my feelings of depression and anxiety could be steered away. The whole year I fought an internal battle with my mind every day. I saw each day of my life pass by. I woke up many mornings hoping I could go back to sleep and not wake up for a long time. I had days of some clarity, but my illness just got worse. I tried everything to cure my mental illness such as becoming more religious, finding new hobbies, going out more but nothing worked. My mind would be temporarily occupied but I still came home each night to my bed of sorrow and hopelessness. My bad thoughts not only affected me, but one of the most important people in my life, my boyfriend. He tried to help me. He became my therapist which later in time broke him. I ran to him every time I needed reassurance and love. And he surpassed my expectations of an amazing human being. But instead of this causing me to get better, I only got worse. My mind switched this and I began to question why I wasnât happy. How could I have everything in the world? (A roof over my head, healthy family and friends, attending an amazing college, and dating this awesome human being). I simply could not understand how I could be depressed. I began questioning my relationship. Began doubting my life, my identity, my ideas, my thoughts, and my feelings for everything. The doubting got so bad that I just became empty. I felt nothing. And this completely terrified me. I had seen myself morph from a happy, determined and cheerful woman, to a terrified, guilty, depressed and confused little girl. I had no idea why my life was falling apart. I saw myself deteriorate as the days, weeks and months passed. My life was falling apart and I had absolutely no control nor will to fight. I decided to end my relationship of 3 and a half years. One of the hardest decisions I had to make. Before my illness, I knew I was going to marry this person. Our relationship was no near perfect, but we loved each other so much. But now, how could I be selfish and be with someone when I didnât have my life, my feelings, or my issues figured out. For once, I understood the stupid cliche of âitâs not you, itâs meâ. My biggest fear of hurting him, had became a reality. My entire life completely fell apart from having a stupid thought that I labeled bad. I over thought this idea I had and it morphed into a fear, a phobia and a obsession in my mind. I simply wanted to be perfect for my significant other but I wasnât. I have my first therapy session with my new therapist next week, January 5th. I have hope that this time, Iâm able to stick with it. I regret not continuing with my therapist when I first saw myself changing. I think, if only I had stayed in therapy, if only I had continued my medication, my illness would have not gotten so bad. I was a ticking time bomb and I just ignored myself. 

If youâve gotten this far of reading my dumb post, please, I beg you, if you are going through some mental health issues, please get medical help. Please. It was one of dumbest mistakes I have ever made in my life. Please, listen to your body and your mind. I always took my mental health for granted and now I wish I could go back every day to a day of normality where Iâm not struggling with my mind. ",3
"Itâs my senior year and I just want a group of friends to hang out with and have inside jokes with. Goddammit it sucks so much being friends with so many fucking people and not being close to a single one of them. I canât even call myself a loner because I talk to so many people at school. 


I was supposed to go all out senior year. I wanted to have the greatest âlastâ summer break, I wanted to carve pumpkins for Halloween and go to a haunted house. I wanted to have a FriendsGiving and I wanted to make a gingerbread house. I wanted to go to a crazy New Years party and count down to 2018. But nobody ever thinks of inviting me because Iâm at best a second tier friend to every person I know. 


It just sucks. ",1
"I'm graduating from college this year, and I'm not ready. I study character technical direction at an art school, and my portfolio is not where it needs to be for job opportunities. I've already taken all the classes on that subject, so now I'll be spread too thin to work on side projects for my demo reel. 

My goal was to spend this break working on projects, improving, and learning. I spent plenty of time working on it, but I haven't been improving much. My sleep schedule started pretty healthy, but now the sun is rising when I finally fall asleep. I love watching movies (that's usually how I pass my time) but now it just seems unappealing. It's starting to take me hours to get out of bed, and my motivation is slipping away. 

Is this just me feeling bummed about my circumstances? Or does it sound like I'm developing depression",2

Sorry for the bad english, i don't have anyone else to talk. This week has been very hard. I've hated myself more than ever and even taking my medications has failed to dispel the emotional pain I feel. I spent the whole year struggling with my depression and even hiding so that my boyfriend doesn't have to worry about it more, and why, so that he decides to cheat and justified by the stress, and the needy that I tend to be. God, I do not know how to explain the pain I feel, her mother speaking bad about me, threatening to talk to my family because she thinks i'm not good enough for her son, blaming me for her son's problems. I can't anymore, I have no one to talk to, I'm getting tired of all this shit, they don't know, his family doesn't know Who i am, i just can't anymore, all this shit in just one week. I need some advice, some support words, please",1
"I'm laying in bed and thinking about what a fucked up year I've had. Seriously, what a fucking shit show. Years of depression and other mental illnesses finally caught up to me. Like it beat the shit out of me. I put an end to something fucked up that I did but the damage is still there and not completely cleared because I don't know how to approach the situation because I'm fucking mentally fucked up and I don't even know how to explain that to someone. I spent days in bed, crying, paranoid walking around outside thinking people know all my secrets and all thats wrong with me. I've spent days being yelled at by my parent, being a second parent to my little sibling and still being told that I do nothing. That I don't give. Being emotionally and verbally abused by my sister. Letting guilt numb me till I can't feel anymore. Hating myself on top of hating myself, to the point where I want to rip myself apart whenever I see my reflection. 21 years and I have no fucking friends. I feel like the biggest piece of shit. I don't know who I am, all I know is that I'm depressed and have issues of identity, gender, personality, and traumatic experiences that fucking haunt me. Every time I told myself to go seek help I failed. Every time I tried to have a good day I came back to my room and cried till nothing came out anymore. It was a fucking shitty year. I don't see anything changing in the new year. Don't even know if I'll make it through. Tough shit. I pray every day that I die because I don't have the courage to do it myself. ",1

Forgive me if I sound extremely stupid but I've finally convinced myself after years of ignoring my depression to go see a doctor. I'm confused as to how the process works if a person does get prescribed medication. I know there are tons of different kinds of medication so how does the doctor know which one to prescribe? Do you have a say in which antidepressants you're leaning towards? I know some of them have severe side effects so I'm wondering if after they've talked with you to inspect you if they give you a choice from a list they feel is best or if they usually start you off the bat with one kind of medication without questions asked.,3

"Hi,
My parents love me, unconditionally, they want the best for me, they have sacrificed a lot for me to come to where I am now, I got a high score in my final exams and I want to become a politician, but my parents won't let me because of the ""sins"" that will be committed, I am religious, the reason I want to become a politician is because my native culture is DYING in my country, the my culture is part of the majority ethnic group, our ethnic group's culture is being wiped off, the government stopped teaching my country's history so children become less patriotic, the police are corrupted, and many more atrocities are committed by the government.

It is my dream, but if I ditch my parents I would want to kill myself, I would not be able to hold in the guilt. My dad also believes that if the elders of the party order you to do something and you don't do it, because it is not moral or just plain stupid,they will kick you off the party, can't I just create my own party?

This post may be a little stupid, but I need some advice. 

Thank you so much! :)

"For the past few years I've been feeling more and more miserable and depressed and I don't know why.

Things that used to make me happy now just leave me feeling empty. I think my last truly happy day was my wedding day 1.5 years ago, which isn't great for a 28 year old guy I guess.

I think the speed at which things feel like they are getting worse seems to increase which each ""episode"", if you can call it that, where I normally have some kind of break down.

I feel like I'm trapped inside my own head, even though I know I should do something, or sometimes even want to do something I just can't. I'm telling myself to get up of the couch and do those things, but my body just doesn't seem to respond. Instead I just sit there and accomplish nothing.

I used to be so much more positive, I completely changed my career in retail to be a web developer and worked my way up to be in charge of my own team. I always fought my way through the pressure and got really far in my career at a young age and then at some point this all started.

Food is a side affect as well as a cause of a lot of my problems. As I'm so unable to get the motivation to do anything, I normally just order takeout rather than cooking food. Which in turn just makes me feel more guilty and the cycle continues.

It's strange, I image if you asked anybody that I work with or any of the few friends that I have they probably all think I'm a happy, outgoing person. The only person who knows is my wife and even then I'm not sure she knows the extent of how I feel. I also don't want to put extra pressure on her as she has dealt with depression before as well. She eventually went to her GP and they gave her some medication that has definitely made a difference to her outlook on life.

This was a while ago but it made me think that maybe I could get up the willpower to go to the doctors and see if they could help me. This morning I made an appointment with the doctor and I thought things might be looking up, but it didn't take long for things to come crashing down to an all time low.

When I got there they said they had been trying to call me all morning because they had to cancel my appointment since the doctor hadn't turned up. Annoying as it may be this should a reasonable excuse. Instead, I could feel myself stood at reception falling apart inside.

Every now and then I've had thoughts like ""Would things be better if I weren't here"" and afterwards I always said to myself that even though I'd thought it I'd never do something like that.

As I was walking home from the doctors, probably about 20 feet from my street where I had to cross over, it hit me. I was considering just walking straight into the road and I didn't even care. I was actually disappointed when I got to the edge of the path and there weren't any cars coming.

I got in the house and had a massive panic attack, I couldn't breath, then I was probably the most angry I've ever been and throwing things about and screaming at things. I didn't know if I was more annoying at myself for wanting to do it, or for not actually doing it.

I've calmed down a bit now and I've apparently got an emergency appointment with a different GP but all of this only happened about an hour ago and I just don't know how to feel or what to do anymore.

Thanks for listening,
Scott",1
"For a little while there, things were looking up. I was talking to lots of people at work and in my classes, I was (kind of) making friends. Nothing serious, but it was 10x better than where I was before. I thought that I was finally getting out of this seemingly endless depression that I was in (I've been dealing with it for years now). For the first time in a very long time I felt like I was getting better.

Ha. Right.

Here I am on New Year's, sitting in my room crying and feeling sorry for myself. Probably going to get drunk in a second. Nobody invited me to do anything or even included me in their mass-texted happy new years wishes. There was one person who I thought I was really hitting it off with who I was going to chill with for new years, but he's suddenly not really talking to me and ditched me tonight (*he* suggested hanging out) to go out and do something else (which he also didn't invite me to). I'm not mad at anybody for not inviting me, don't get me wrong I know I'm not entitled to an invite to anything. But shit...why am I even fucking trying? Apparently I'm not worth being friends with. I'm just the last resort when you're so bored at work or school that you'll talk to whoever's around. 

And it's not even like ""oh don't take it personally, everyone has 'work friends' separate from people they actually hang out with all he time."" But even that's not true. Everyone at my job is super close and they hang out all the time in big groups. I was the only one in my tiny department (besides the guys who work in the back and don't really interact with those of us up front) not to get invited to a coworker's wedding.

Sometimes I honestly wonder if I'll ever have friends again. Honestly. That sounds so melodramatic but I can never get past ""acquaintance."" I can't even get people to add me on fucking Facebook. Why bother",1
I donât want to go back to school this week. Itâs hard being alone at school. Itâs hard finding a place to sit at lunch or where to chill in the morning. Its hard doing group or partner work when you donât have friends in any of your classes. Itâs hard to get over a breakup when your dad doesnât let you go out to stay busy with your barely existing friends. Itâs hard when you stay at home and try to talk to your ex when you know the conversation is going to end quickly. Itâs hard when you crave your exâs company just to not feel so alone but you know itâs impossible. Itâs hard knowing your friends/peers are doing just fine with you isolating yourself. Itâs hard,2
I told a guy who I thought was my friend something personal. It wasnât too deep but something anyone with half a brain should know not to share. I told my âfriendâ not to share it. I only told him something personal because he wanted to know more about me. So I opened up. But I also told him not to tell people about my family. I thought he was cool and we were friends for a couple weeks. I was new to making friends after deciding to open out of my shell. But now that this asshole tells people lies and rumors about me it just broke me. He tried texting me saying he didnât say anything but obviously Iâm not that stupid. This seriously just broke me down. I hate people who use me for company. I just canât trust anyone or make friends. Now the school thinks Iâm a crazy weirdo. Some fvcked up lies have been said about me. I donât even talk to anyone besides a couple people. How did this happen. Assholes. :(,1

More so a voice in my head that sounds very familiar to me father's that just tears me down from the inside out when I get down, and then I feel like that me being down all the time is gonna fuck up things with my fiance, she loves me and helps me a ton but I feel like I'm a burden on her and I don't like any of this. I know this is just a rough patch and that things will get better but right now it's hard for me to see that and I just needed to unload thus jumbled mess of thoughts off my chest.

"The last few years of my life have been really difficult for me. I've been dealing with a couple sexual assaults that all happened during the last 5 years. And its just really bad timing because these past few years were supposed to be me learning how to adult and shit. So instead of learning how to cook chicken or graduate college, I've been sleeping a lot, smoking weed. Trying, failing, and succeeding at coping.

Anyways. My parents do everything they can for me, but they have their own problems too and they aren't the most educated or successful people in the world (career and finances- strictly speaking). So sometimes I get a bit frustrated with them. So a couple weeks into December, and my mom tells me I have to sign up for healthcare because they are dropping me from their plan. I applied quick, but I guess since it was so close to the deadline and lots of others are doing the same, the state still hasn't followed up with me. (I was notified that I qualified, and that the next step would be to wait for a rep to contact me). 

My therapist will be back from vacation next week and I've been hanging on a thread without her. But I just realized that I might not be able to have an appointment with her if I don't have health insurance.

So right now I'm kind of in a pre panic attack state. Typing this all out kind of helped in a weird way.

"Hi, 
do any of you have practical advice and methods on how to overcome fear? There are some things I have to do which, when I try to start them, cause me to have this intense freezing fear.  In my case it can be opening various mail or even starting to read some book. It could even be when I decide to rent a movie. I know I shouldnât be afraid and I do not see rational reasons for it, but I get waves of fear that feel like there is a predator that is going to attack. I feel it and I am gripped with stillness and fear as if I am hiding and canât move or breathe heavily because it could reveal my position. 

Because of this I end up not doing things I have to do, missing some deadlines, not going to the dentist. Well the dentist is understandable since no one wants to go to them. In my case it is mundane things.

"I'm 30 and have been depressed since 15, the age at which I realized I wasn't going to be tall and handsome and gave up on life. I get worse whenever I see porn, since I chastise myself for not having the genetics to date and bang hot women. I asked an aesthetics forum to rate pictures of me, they said 6-7, but it means almost nothing to me if it's not 9.

The one thing that keeps me from killing myself is thinking about how I could change my life around. I'm currently selling my stuff so I can afford lasik, then braces to fix my teeth. I'd also love to get limb lengthening on my legs by 3"" to make me about 6', but I have a small head and worry that I won't look good. I've done research on how to apply for gene therapy clinical trials and other radical reconstruction. I honestly don't care what the complications would be, I'm THAT unhappy. I think about suicide already, and I would end it if it happened to not work out.

I wasted a lot of time before realizing this ""my way or bust"" mindset, and I hope anyone younger than me can take away that you'll regret not solving your problems sooner if you don't start now.

"Hi all.

Not sure this is the right place for this; I submitted it on r/suicidewatch but there's so many threads on there I fear I won't get any replies.  I need some help and i'm scared to call a suicide hotline for fear of them staging an intervention or some such thing.

This is a first for me -- I've had moments in my life where i've felt close to the edge but things have been really hard recently.

I'll cut to the chase here.

Three years ago I suffered a workplace accident and broke my L3-l4 vertebrae, in addition to my hip. I sustained mid back complications as well that have caused heavy spasms and contusions. I've been fighting workers' comp for all three of these years to get treatment. I got my spine fused two years ago and my hip a little less than a year ago -- while things are better, to the extent that I can walk and such, I live in constant pain and discomfort. I still need to ice my lower and middle back constantly. I recently successfully applied and got invited to my dream job in the Peace Corps, but when I got to medical clearance they told me I couldn't handle the job. This has left me devastated. I thought I could beat this thing through sheer force of will, but my plans have crumbled to nothing and I don't know what to do.

Moreover, I was molested at a Christian summer camp when I was 11 years old and i have never been able to move past it. It has completely impaired my ability to form emotional attachments and even to perform sexually -- not necessarily all the time, but enough that i have blown every chance I've had at romantic normality or happiness. I fear it's messed me up beyond repair.

I am now 25 and tottering under the weight of these burdens. While in the past i've had an active and enjoyable social life and great/varied friends, a mixture of chronic pain and my own personality defects led to me having a very lonely ahd depressing New Year's -- a massive contrast from only a year ago, when I had a pretty damn good time.

The holiday isn't the cause, of course -- it's more just the catalyst to underlying issues I can't seem to beat.

I am lonely. I am in pain. I want desperately to live a normal life but I no longer believe it is possible.

Is there anyone out there who has beaten something like this? What the hell do I do? Where do I turn? How do I overcome this? Is it even worth it? I just want it all to stop.

I would appreciate any advice. I really would. I need 2018 to be different, and I fear it will not be.",1

"I've been on antidepressants for around 4 or 5 years, but I'm still a mess. I have no control over my emotions, my panic attacks and general anxiety lead me to ruin friendships and relationships, I have fits of rage that also lead me to say things I don't mean but obviously can't take back, which has made me a very lonely person because no one wants to be around someone like that. I don't blame them. I lost someone that I really really love because of all this shit. It's hard on my parents, it's been hard on the people around me and that's why they leave. I've ruined so many things that I can't fix.

I hate my school. I love what I'm studying but the program at my school for it is a joke. All of the people in my program are annoying, I don't really like them. This past semester though, I started hanging out with them occasionally out of loneliness. That's not a good foundation for friendships.

This past year I've done a lot of growing, I've realized how shitty of a person I am, how selfish I am and how I've ruined every good relationship and friendship in my life. I still have no confidence, I'm still constantly paranoid, I'm always worried about my family members dying or something. I live 400 miles away from my childhood home. I have no friends where I live. My parents don't believe me when I say I have no friends. My mom says ""that's not true,"" and my dad just mocks me. Everything has gotten worse since starting antidepressants. If I hadn't started them, my anxiety and depression wouldn't have become a ""thing"" and everything would have been fine.

So this year, my goal is to get off antidepressants. So I'm going to do that. But where do I go from here? How do I take care of myself? How do I rebuild my life? How do I make friends? I need to start my life over, but how? I've ruined so much of my life. I'm not suicidal, I could never do that to my parents and my sisters and my family. But I feel so hopeless. I don't want to be here anymore. I'm 23 and I feel like my life is over. ",2
"The more I sit back and think. The more I realize that I'll never recover from the psychological damage both high school and college have caused me.

People were just downright awful to me in high school. I was physically, emotionally, and mentally abused by shit heads that live in my neighborhood. It's like there mission was to make my life miserable. They ruined my life in every way. They posted humiliating pictures of me online. They beat me up whenever they feel like it. They called me horrible names. You name it they did it. 

My senior year prom date was a complete bitch. She didn't talk to me for the entire night and abandoned me for her friends. Literally everything was perfect we talked every day, I asked her to prom. Then it all went downhill. She never acknowledged me presence in school. She was so rude to me on prom night. I regret following her around like I was some stupid sheep. Should have just left her. I recently snapped and got really mad at her when we didn't talk for awhile. I let her have it and I feel no remorse that I lashed out on her. She deserved it with the hell she put me through. She broke my heart and ruined my prom night. Something I'll never get back.

I had no friends in high school. People would just ignore me. Never asked me for plans. They were all just fake ass people. They always talked to people that were better then me. I was always a second choice. Not even a fucking second choice. 

High school set the stages and fucking destroyed any positive view I have on people. I often stormed out of classes and broke down crying in the guidance office because of how I was treated. Nobody gave a shit. I was sent home one day after having a complete meltdown, throwing a tissue box at my counselor, crying, and getting so mad to the point I almost passed out. I literally hate people. All I have done was be friendly to them and they have to treat me like shit in return. People did some nasty things to me and I was suicidal. Now I come out of high school with an extremely hateful view on people my age. I wanted friends and I still want friends, but literally me getting friends is just super unlikely. So I just sit back and watch the others have fun while I rot.

College? Heh, people told me college would be different. My parents made me go to my local community college and that decision fucked over any chance of me having a normal college social life. I'm mad at my parents to this day for not letting me go to a college I wanted to go to. Now I'll never get to experience the joys of living in a dorm and I don't have any friends for an apartment. I hate college. Nobody at my college talks to each other. It's antisocial and I'm often sitting alone or walking alone. Nobody talks to me. I even approach people in class, nobody talks to me.

Now a little bit about myself. I'm extremely shy. Yes, I've gotten better at it but honestly, this doesn't make a difference because I even talked to people and they still wouldn't act like I'm there.

I also am not much of a partier. I hate parties and I just hate being around drugs and alcohol. It just isn't my kind of fun and I always stay away from it.

Literally laying here in my bed crying which I have been for the last fucking week. I don't have a therapist appointment till Friday. My therapist is too busy to talk too. I honestly don't think I'll make it to Friday. I am becoming suicidal again and I just don't see a point in living through these awful college + high school years. Even if I make it, I'm so psychologically fucked up from high school and college that it will impact me in the future. I don't want to live anymore. I just want to be happy again and sadly I think ending it is the only way as I can't get anything going for me.",1
"I was with a group of friends last night, and another friend started talking to another friend about how many girls secretly liked him and stuff. It was crazy, because no one has ever talked to me about things like that. Then, on the way to the pub, a group of girls basically called me unattractive. Funny how girls are never shy about calling me ugly, but they're apparently too shy to ""approach me"". I never get signals, I've had shit luck on dating sites, no one ever approaches me, no one has ever had a crush on me, and my family are the only people that call me handsome. Nothing tells me that I'm ugly based on how girls treat me versus how they treat other guys.

"Hi there. Sorry this is a bit long. I'm looking for some advice or words of wisdom on how to cope with a severely depressed and suicidal best friend.

We've been best friends since high school. We went to different colleges, but she ended up transferring to my school (huge state school) this year. It's been hard on her -- she hasn't made many friends. I hung out with her often and always invited her out with my friends, but I think she feels uncomfortable joining and my friends find her to be annoying. She's been struggling with depression and anxiety for as long as I've known her and has been consistently in therapy. She thought she was bipolar, but recently found out that she actually has borderline personality disorder and her parents/doctors have known for years. I think this makes her even more depressed.

This year she got really into xanax and was constantly barred out. I don't fuck with drugs for a lot of reasons and she is always pressuring me to try them, so I feel very uncomfortable around her when she's super messed up. One night she showed up at my dorm at 3am and passed out in the hallway after taking 7 bars and mixing it with alcohol. I took her to the emergency room and she stayed at the hospital for several days in the psychiatric ward. She doesn't get along with her family and refused to let her parents visit her or make any medical decisions. During this time, I was the only person she would contact so I brought her everything she needed, visited multiple times daily, helped her get excuses for all her classes, etc. 

After this incident she promised she was done with xanax. I know now that she continued to abuse it almost daily, but was more secretive about it. She went out and partied every weekend, acting like everything was fine. She got fired from her job (we work together) and failed all her exams. She found out that she's pregnant and doesn't know who the father is, and asked me to come with her to get an abortion. She told me she was going to take the next semester off and try to figure things out. She blamed me for encouraging her to transfer and not being there for her. In hindsight, I know I could have done more to help her adjust to the new school, but she repeatedly told me she didn't like my friends and wanted to make her own. 

She hooked up with my ex boyfriend when she was blacked out. I forgave her because I know she doesn't remember it and wouldn't have done it sober, but it still upsets me when I think about it.

Two days ago she tried to kill herself. She drank half a bottle of vodka and took 20+ different types of pills. She sent me a suicide note via text in which  she wanted me to send paragraphs she'd written to multiple different people. There was a note for me at the end-- she said that I ""was never there for her"" and that she feels sorry for me because I'm more ""fucked up"" than she is and I don't even realize it. 

I called her immediately, got her to send me her location, and then called 9-1-1 and her parents. When the ambulance got there, she was foaming at the mouth and they said she would have died within 20-30 minutes. Her mom has been keeping me updated the past two days. She woke up today and luckily doesn't have any brain damage. She's been asking to talk to me but doesn't have access to her phone and doctors won't let her speak or visit with any non-family members.

I just don't know what to do. The past six months have been hell for her, but also for me. She hasn't been there as a friend at all, which is completely understandable given the situation, but I've found myself becoming more distant from her. She tells me that I'm the best friend she's ever had, and then the next day says everyone else is telling her to not be my friend because I'm such a shitty person? I feel like I'm becoming depressed myself now. My therapist told me that the friendship is toxic. Everyone thinks I'm crazy for sticking by her. But all  her other friends have abandoned her. I see how much pain she's in, and I know she would do the same for me. At the same time I don't think I can keep this up much longer. I'm still her best friend, but she's no longer mine.

It makes me so sad to think about all of the good memories we have together. Would a true friend stand by her through this, even though she doesn't seem to want me to? I don't ever want to be in this situation again where her life is in my hands. Any advice/input would be greatly appreciated.",1
"I often think about ways I could maybe kill myself. Like stabbing a kitchen knife into my heart or stepping in front of a bus. I donât know if that would work or if Iâd ever actually do it but the thoughts are there. 

Sometimes I feel like I want to die. Like I donât care if I died or not at that moment. But sometimes I donât want to at all. Does that make sense/is that normal? 

I was raped a few years ago but have never spoken to someone professional about it. My husband knows but he doesnât speak about it and tells me I should talk to someone if I want to. I donât know if he just isnât the kind of talking person or if he doesnât actually care - it was a mutual friend of ours and he knows that. 

When I watch tv programmes or see news articles of people getting raped I get really angry, I think this might be when I start thinking about ways I could die. If I was dead Iâd never have to be reminded or think about rape again. 

Some days my thoughts overwhelm me and I donât want to get out of bed. I want to get up and have a nice day but something just seems to stop me. I donât know what and I just feel really shit and down. 

Am I just being stupid? Or is this something that is normal? Should I get professional help?

"Last year at this time, I was working in tech support being yelled at by people I don't know.  This year, I have a terminally ill family member and I'm struggling to find a place to live as I'm being kicked out of my old place.

I've no idea what to do anymore.  Every day I wake up feeling sicker and sicker, my head is just full of clouds, I can't find my knife that I usually use to relieve the pressure (I suspect one of my friends stole it once they realized what it was for).  I'd ask for a hug, but I'm terrified of contact with people and it would just make me feel worse.  

It feels like there's a noise in my head that's just getting louder and louder, like someone turning up the volume on a TV station that's nothing but static.  People keep telling me how impressed they are by how smart I am, but I only look smart compared to those who don't actively reject everything that's supposed to make them feel like a person.  Academic medals mean nothing to someone who isn't human.

"There's no sugarcoating it really. I have a history of being abused, neglected, and living very poor. I'm 18 now and everything was going great since my birthday (septemeber). I was about to graduate, I had a girlfriend I adored, friends always wanting to do something, and I just generally felt happy. Until early December when my abuser came back into my life ( and I'm too much of a bitch to tell amyone other than my best friend ), one of my friends became toxic and we've slowly distanced, and then my girlfriend dumped me. I was actually dealing with everything well enough but her dumping me was the straw that broke the fragile camel's back. Short anecdote, but my first girlfriend and I broke up in April. I being a vulnerable 17 year old idiot, decided to go on tinder and just find someone, someone who could fill that void. Instead of dating though I just fucked. And not in a good ""I'm having so much sex it feels great!"" kinda way, but more in a last ditch effort for a sense of validity and feeling wanted, followed by complete resentment and disgust in myself afterwards. My current ex helped me not live like this anymore back in June, but then she ended things on the 27th. It was after a long text about all my problems that was induced by a severe overload of anxiety. I don't feel like she's not justified, I just wish I hadn't sent her that. My mind instead of talking it out or anything instead defaulted to my old habits. It's been one week and I've had a one night stand with three different people. I hate it, I never feel macho or confidence boosted after just gross and shameful.

Sex and I have always sorta been like that though. I mentioned my abuser, in short she molested and raped me multiple times through blackmail when I was 15. That's how I lost my virginity. I get that society places too much of an emphasis on it but my first sexual experience was while I was crying, screaming for her to stop, and being berated. I would have preferred better. So after then I just stopped caring about it or myself and just did it whenever I was with someone willing to do such. I always convince myself though, that the person I'm about to have sex with will be someone I want to be with, but that's never the case, yet I keep falling for it. I feel like a sociopath, I keep using other people for a fucked up sense of emotional relief, a way to forget about my ex-girlfriends, to forget about how much I used to care, and to convince myself I've always been this way, I just hided it.

I don't even know if half of this makes sense. I'm not even fully aware of why do it to be honest I think I'm addicted but I'm too terrified to admit that. This is more me just venting about being a manipulative cunt. Rarely do people ever actually read what I post, which usually leads to me deleting them, but if anyone is reading this, can you just tell me if I'm a horrible person for doing this because I can't help but feel as such.",1

"I'm 15 and from the UK, in year 11 in secondary school. I'm male and although probably not gay, probably not exactly straight either. And I'm autistic, self-loathing and fucking stupid.

I've got two (relatively) close friends, let's call them John and Steve. I'm starting to develop feelings for John, which doesn't help my situation at all. Occasionally I play PC games with them, but I haven't recently.

I've also got an old 'friendship' group from a few years ago who I am no longer friends with because they're narcissistic dickheads who were closer to bullies than to actual friends. There are two I despise the most - let's call them Mike and James.

So, over the past year or so John's been mostly hanging around with other friends (who I occasionally talk to however would not consider myself to be friends with) and largely been ignoring me in school. I've tried to ask him to talk to me more but he pretty much ignored me. I've not told him that I have a crush on him yet but that'll probably only worsen it.

That said, occasionally for a week or so he'll start trying to talk to me over his other friends. Surprises me massively, and definitely in a positive way, yet sooner or later he just goes back to his other friends and I'm just another passing person, just another one of the 1000+ people in my school, and he's barely even acknowledging our friendship. What annoys me even more is that when I am in a Discord (voice chat app for those who don't know) call with Steve (or someone else from my school), they'll sometimes add one of John's friends to the call randomly. I'm perfectly fine with this until they say that John's calling them and leave. Why would he call them all of the time and not me? It frustrates me so much.

And then there's Steve, who's decided that he's going to go hang around with Mike and James and their friend group. I tried to talk to him a few days ago on their Discord server. Mike and Steve instead left the server to avoid me, and not long after that I was banned from the server for trying to talk to my friend on it.

So, now I've got my best friend (and crush) ignoring me in favour of other friends of his and going out with other friends, my other close friend just kinda... ignoring me and joining a group of assholes instead.

Yes, I am that guy who stands alone during break/lunch (or recess for Americans), hoping that just one 'friend' will bother talking to me.

I'm not sure speaking to my parents will be a good idea here. They're all much more outgoing and social than I am, and had more friends than me in school, and I don't think they will fully understand how I feel.

I guess I could try opening up to John, but I'm scared it'll just break down the friendship we've had for nearly 2 years (which is a long time for me). He probably still won't want to hang out with me anywhere near as frequently as his other friends, either.

I don't think Steve would understand if I did open up to him, and I can't now anyway as he's decided to block me in favour of Mike. Downright fucking brilliant.

My final option would be to try talking to one of my old friends who isn't a complete cunt to me nowadays. There are a few reasons why I haven't tried to restore my friendship with them, mostly the fact that they're always around complete cunts who they're much closer to than they ever were to me.

My school starts again on Thursday, and I know that I'm probably going to be lonely the entire term. I just need to come to terms with it.

Anyway, I doubt anyone's going to read this, and I feel somehow worse after writing all of this down, but I'm going to force myself to submit this post anyway. Sorry for the post being horribly written as well; I don't want to read it again because it just makes me feel even more shitty.

"I am a 20 year old male who has 0 friends, never had a girlfriend, and live with my mom.  I dropped out of high school and have no interest in getting a ged. I have social anxiety, severe depression and anger.  I have been suicidal but I know it doesn't end my pain but just end my life.  I don't see myself doing that but I hate being miserable.  We get 1 life and I would like to enjoy it.  I've been alone, not leaving the house much since I was 14.  I have a lot of built up anger, boredom, and just want to enjoy myself.

Getting a girlfriend is one of my biggest goals, but even then, I feel with all my built up anger and depression, I would be very rude and a terrible boyfriend.

Some health problems I have are:
 I have hives called cholinergic urticaria(my skin becomes EXTREMELY painful when i get hot, or stressed, or whenever a person may sweat) It also affects my legs which are extremely itchy so i can't stand for too long.  There isn't really a cure for it.

things I have done the year of 2017 to help my hives and social anxiety:
I eat healthy, take an antihistamine, and exercise which signficantly helped my hives but they are still there and are creeping back.
For social anxiety I went to a psychologist for months and helped slightly but stopped because it wasn't doing anything.  I take paxil and I went from never leaving the house to going on daily walks, family holidays, and the occasional walk in stores.  I still don't have a driver's liscense.

I am also very depressed, I have social anxiety, and I have A LOT of built up anger.

I have seen psychologists, therapist, etc and it just doesn't help.  Talking about my depression does nothing.  The last psychologist helped by answering some questions involving social interaction but didn't help my depression.  I have taken meds and I am currently taking paxil but I am against using anti-depressants.  I am not embarrased by it, but I feel it is unnatural and possibly dangerous in the long run.  

The reason I am here is asking what type of job/career can I pursue with my social anxiety, hives(won't be able to do any physcial work, standing for long periods of time, a lot of social interaction, etc) I feel the best possible way is to work from home or on the computer.  

I have searched and searched and haven't found anything that would work.

A dream job for me is make youtube videos but that is 1 in a million to make a living as well as I don't think I could be entertaining with my severe depression and anger, and social anxiety.

I feel being able to save up money to move out on my own would significantly help my depression.  I hate living with my mom.  I am good at saving and am very cheap.  A studio apartment if fine with me but it seems wiser to buy a house instead.  

Any help is greatly appreciated. ",2

I also have terrible coping mechanisms, I mostly play video games to pass the time, I am smart as my mother constantly reminds me, but all I see are my failures. I only find happiness from other people, I am always angry and sad, and this paragraph is a mess and now I'm crying.

"EDIT: I was in a bad mood, mostly frustrated as the songs I made in the period of 2 weeks I was created hadn't struck a chord with me, but since the responses i've gotten i've since got a new perspective on it. To anyone who creates music, just know your stuff isn't shit. the effort you put into it is really something of its own amazing, and not everyone is gonna like your stuff. ",2
Can I trade bodies with a straight white boy. Nobody is into me because I'm black. I'm drunk and done with existing. Maybe I'll just black out and die. That's the dream.,1
"I don't really want to die, or rather I don't have any reason to and I want to not want to die, but I still know that probably in the next 5-10 years I'll just do it. I won't make some long post here, I won't call for help or show any major signs, I probably won't even give/have a good reason, I just know that one day I'm going to wake up and go throughout my day like normal, and then just jump off the roof or hang myself or something. The older I get the less in control of my own thoughts I feel, but I also feel like I have a better understanding of them. I can see how people can just go crazy and seemingly snap and start killing people or hijack a bus or start just running around naked or something, and if anything I'm lucky enough to know that I have no urge to harm others and would do anything to save someone that isn't myself, but I just feel the need to off myself and I know that eventually it'll just happen. Lately I've noticed myself getting into a lot more dangerous situations I think maybe because I feel a need to have control over my own death, and that getting in random fights with junkies on the subway and getting hit by cars when chasing the bus excites me because my life (or death) isn't in my control. I don't know maybe I'm the only one that feels this way but I wanted to see if anyone else had any similar experiences or tips with how to feel less trapped by my own depression.",1
"Iâm 17 and my mental health is at an all time low. I think about killing myself every day, but I never go through with it because of my parents, whom I love very much. The thing is, my grades have gone from As to Ds and Fs. I canât bring myself to do anything. I keep asking for extensions but not fulfilling them. I have no friends and I spend everyday sleeping.
After a 6 year battle with depression, I want it all to be over. Iâm either killing myself, or Iâm fixing this by going to a mental hospital. Do I need my parentsâ consent to be admitted? How long do you usually stay? And what has your experience been?",2

"It happens at least twice a week:  some jerk cuts me off when I'm talking or a coworker simply ignores what I just said, and I instantly start hating on myself. ""People interrupt me because I'm a wimp."" ""I'm the only one they treat like this."" 

Anybody else?",2
"I never had much friends throughout my life. Never really hang out or play tag when I was a kid. I was a obscure kid with your self-esteem. Occasionally got bullied, cried a little, didnât tell anyone and lived on with it. I have make some pretty good friends after I grew up, they were friends I could talk with. Weâre now working adults now and well, we drifted apart.
Iâm at my work, have no problem with social interaction and self-esteem anymore. I feel like my life have been a performance. I fake a smile to my colleagues, to my parents but I know that Iâm still that kid, wanting something more from life. I questioned myself have I ever been happy and no I have not. I feel like a failure in everything I do. Every step I take forward just spiral me deeper. I thought I could outgrow depression, but living into my late 20s, I donât think thats possible. Maybe I just hate myself, maybe I hate society for making me this way.
The only thing that is make my life worth living is entertainment that keep my mind from thinking about my depression, pushing me onwards till I finally die. ",1
"But they think it's cause I got too fucked up and didn't know what I was talking about. I feel like a fucking idiot for doing it, I never thought the words would come out of my mouth in front of anyone. I don't know if them believing me or thinking I'm lying is worse. 

I figured if I ever told anyone they'd care, or you know, say fucking anything about it. But all's back to normal now, they didn't have any sort of revelation out of it. I just got too drunk, is all. 

I can't wait until they hear the news I've finally done it, and they just think ""Fuck. She wasn't just too drunk.""",3
"If I am unable to turn things around and make myself content, I will pull the trigger. The way I see it, if I cannot do it in a year, I will never be able to do it. I am tired of moving in circles. Either I start living, or I to on dying. 

I feel oddly relieved by this. Is anyone else doing something similar?",3
"I'm fairly young, junior in high school , but I do not wish to disclose my age. My mom is a hardcore muslim, forcing her religion on me and all my sisters. My sisters are much older than I am...one is addicted to adderall, and two are depressed. I developed a drug and alcohol problem  in sophomore year of high school which escalated very quickly. I even almost overdosed off of a combination of xanax and alcohol.

I used all these drugs and alcohol just because they were fun, not because I was depressed or sad or anything. My alcohol problem climaxed when I almost fought a police officer at a party when I was drunk. This led my mom to making me see a psychologist, and I genuinely felt bad for my substance abuse so I left drinking all at once.

During the summer I became addicted to Xanax because I was terrified of my dad catching me drinking, that I just resorted to Xanax, as it is a cheap drunk. When school started in September, I had minor xanax withdrawal and I felt terrible. I started to drink moderately again.

Just some more background... I feel like my dad genuinely dislikes me, and just tries to hide it up with fake conversations. All my sisters tell me my dad is a psycho when it comes to me. My dad always tries to turn my mom against me, calling me a manipulator and all types of shit. We have a shitty relationship as we aren't even close. My alcohol problem is misleading as I still get good grades in school, and I have very good studying habits. I strive so hard in school because I want to leave my shitty life behind

My life started to spiral out of control fast, and I became depressed, anxious, and restless. I partied every weekend and drank a lot, but my parents wouldn't catch me as I am good at acting sober. I started drinking on weekdays, and I started to feel so lonely. 

I finally met a girl, and not to sound corny, but I genuinely fell in love. She likes me a lot, and she actually makes me happy. For some reason she makes me anxious and restless too, so I started to have a harder drinking problem. I do not know why she gets me so restless, but I do know that it's really fucking us up. Because of my mood swings I always begin to flirt with her, getting her hopes up, and then I suddenly crash and I turn her down. I know I'm hurting her a lot, but I have so much shit going on in my life that it distracts me. I think I don't want to get too close to her for a fear of being left and hurt.

My life became hectic when my mom found beers in my room, and my parents realized my alcohol problem was still present. I know my mom genuinely cares, but her shoving religion in my throat gets me angrier, as I can't have a normal relationship with her because she only talks about school and religion. I know my dad on the other hand does not care about my drinking habit, but just that he wants to shit on me.

We had a family party I had to attend to, and I know this was a poor decision, but me and my family friend drank a little bit. I got breathalyzed by my dad when I came home, and I blew a .04. My dad promised he wouldn't tell my mom if I stopped drinking, and I made a deal. When my mom heard from someone that I was drinking, my dad quickly turned on me and texted my mom discretely about our deal. I confronted my dad and he blatantly lied to my face about it, even deleting the messages off his phone and showing it to me, acting like he never texted my mom. My mom gave up on me and said I was garbage with an alcohol problem, and it actually hurt me deeply

I started drinking even harder as I felt my parents stopped caring for me, and my dad caught me with alcohol again, and they told me to leave the house. I was packing my bags, and my mom gave me a bunch of garbage bags. I was about to leave the house when my mom told me that if I left, I would never be allowed back in. I stayed home, and my mom said I was a disgrace and all that shit. I didn't care what she had to say, but she said I might have to go to rehab

I know I have a drinking problem and a lot of psychological problems, but I think it's best I leave the house for a month. I have many friends houses to stay at, and I have enough money to live away from home for a month. I genuinely want to find peace in my life again, and I am in such a shit hole right now that it hurts to think about. I told my sister about leaving the house, and she never dismissed it, as she was kicked out the house for a month too. Is this the right way to find peace in my life again?

"I just sent this to my longtime friend and business partner. He knows me better than anyone. 

""Did you not see a difference in me on Friday? My vocabulary, my sense of humor, not just one comment, but I saw and responded with timing. You commented on the fluidity of my speech. The way I pushed Kevin from 30 days to 2 weeks instantly? Thinking of the blue tooth ****** camera/app?  Sure any one of those things can happen with me, but not all in one day for me for years.

"Alone at New Year's Eve. I remembered that my friends were on their sides, partying with their friends, and I'm not even here. I drank a beer earlier to have some sort of fun... but I don't feel like drinking the second one I bought.

"When I was a kid I loved to write little short stories and draw random stuff, wherever my mind was inspired to go. Now Iâm 20 and thanks to depression it feels like my mind canât digest anything.

"My finals were coming up. I screwed them. I passed somwhow. I was depressed. I had a hard time explaining why I was like this to my family and friends. I wanted him. He didn't. I started cutting my arm and all, hoping he'd get sympathetic and stay with me. I didn't care what the reason was. Love or whatever. I just wanted. Him. 

Things happened. And we broke up. I was with another guy. I thought that would just be a rebound thing but right now, almost three and a half years later, we're still going strong. 
That chapter of my life was over. I was happier. But it took almost a year and a half to completely get over him. My ex. 

Down to reason 2 Now. 
2.  Moving away for college. I thought that's just the change that I needed in life but I was wrong. I hated it there in college. It was so lonely. I had Friends. But no one to actually hang out with. I was alone. Wanting to go back home where everything was familiar. But that wasn't possible. I tried taking with my mom and dad. But they wouldn't listen. So I asked stuck. I wasn't doing good in class. I was trying. I got better in classes. But mentally iy was hard. 

Then came pleurisy. A lung condition. And a sudden attack of asthma. Pericarditis. And some other minor things. 
Sick and alone. I started getting bitter. Negativity surrounded Me. Life seemed useless. There was nothing to look forward to.  Nothing to live for. I had friends and family and a significant other who loved me a lot and I loved him back. But none of that seemed important enough to live for. 
I tried taking to him. Explaining why I was acting the way I was but I guess after sometime he got fed up. He understood me but not too well.  

To him it was like me making negativity and sadness a hobby. But that wasn't the case. He tried. He really tried all that he could. But I was in too deep. He told me to force myself to be happy, think happy and be happy, but it's not so easy you know?

You'll only know how it is if you feel it yourself. 
I was stuck. I started cutting my arm and taking high doses of whatever Med I could find and sleeping pills. I wanted to sleep forever. To die. I started planning and plotting the best ways to die painlessly.  I was a wimp, a pussy. I wanted to die but I was too chicken to actually do it. 
I walked out In the middle of the night multiple times wandering around aimlessly trying to clear my mind, to make a decision. It was useless. I wanted to walk up in front of a car or a bus and get hit and die. I tried that. I got scared and never succeeded. 


Now a year later, when my medical conditions are fine and I finally thought I was over it all. I started feeling sad one again last night. Like life was meaningless.  Nothing to look forward too. 

I want to die
Again

I'm scared that everything will change in the future. Nothing will be the same. I'm not the kind of person that can look forward to the future. I want to cling on to the past I don't know why. 

I'm sad

I'm stupid and useless and overly emotional. 


Should I do it? ",3
"I seriously don't know what is wrong with me.

The best way that I could describe it is 2 tracks are constantly playing in my head. One that is normal and happy. I have lots of friends. I have a good job lined up and am doing very well at university. This track sends out lots of positive emotions and appreciates life.

But for the last 2 years theres another track that CONSTANTLY talks about how every single thing is meaningless. A gorgeous sunset? Life is meaningless, there is no purpose to anything. Having a good time with friends? Life is meaningless. The best way that I ccould describe it is like a stone lodged in your shoe that you have no way to remove, and you have to go on a 50 mile hike.

Well I've had enough. There have been times when I have a respite and I feel normal. But they last a couple hours, a couple days at max.

I don't htink I have depression since I think a lot of positive things often, am not socially isolated or anything like that. In fact when I read the stories of people who are depressed or anxious I ENVY them. Because they seem to be upset about something concrete. Like they feel inadequate. They are scared what others will think of them. They are scared of things IN THE REAL WORLD. But whatever is bogging down is so frightening because there is no concrete root. I couldn't care less what people think of me. There's nothing in the real world that totally takes over my mind, because no matter WHAT i am thinking about, always what is playing in the back of my head is ""this is pointless, this is pointless, this is pointless...""

But clearly there is something very chemically wrong with my brain and I just cannot take it anymore. I dream of going to the doctor and finding that I have a terminal illness, so that it will end and I will finally be free of the rock.",3

"hi. 

i had another account somewhere but i forgot the login to it, haha. but that's okay. i just wanted to check in, as a sort of outlet for myself since i don't really get the chance ever to just put my thoughts out there. 

it's the new year. happy 2018, by the way. i hope you all achieve what you wish. i spent the eve alone - by choice. i'm 18 years old, and i'm home on winter break currently from my first semester of college. i haven't really spent time with anybody since being back, though. i have my parents and two older brothers. my parents - we don't necessarily have the best relationship but it's not a bad one either. it's kind of just a mutual understanding of boundaries. i give them what they want and they don't intrude on my personal life kind of deal - you know? and my brothers, they're 11+ years older than i am. and it's not like they don't like spending time with me, it's just...they never really make themselves available for me to reach out.

my oldest brother called me minutes after the clock struck 12 to wish me a happy new year and he asked me what i was doing. and i said nothing, of course and he just told me that i could've called them. which was a nice sentiment in theory but i don't know how to reach out to someone that's never really been reachable. 

i guess right now i'm just feeling lonely. and i've realized that i've been feeling this way for a while now. i don't have anyone to talk to. and the people that i thought i did, my friends, are becoming less my friends and more so people who need/want me by convenience. i don't have anyone. but i guess that's nothing new, i just thought things had changed. and that i was living a better life in college.

speaking of, tuition sucks. when i was still in high school, everyone was just like ""nooo you'll get money to pay for school, don't worry! they practically just give money out for students to go."" or ""apply to scholarships! apply, apply, apply!"" like two opposite ends of the spectrum. but no one really walks you through any sorts of processes that you need to go through in order to pay for college. they kinda just throw it at you. i mean, thankfully i managed to get it sorted out. but too bad i had to figure it out on my own. and eventually, i'll have to pay out all these loans on my own too haha. 

i love going to college, it's fun and i feel like i can be a different person there. a more confident, self-assured one. but if i don't figure out all this money, i won't be able to go. my parents haven't really paid a single lick towards my schooling, but they want me to go to school. my mom even took $500 out of my account to use for something else. i mean, she asked to take it out but who am i to say no to my own mother? 

i'm considering just calling it quits after this next semester and maybe just go to community college for a bit then transfer? work a job at the same time too to save up. but then to me, it'll just be like i put in all that work to get myself into a nice school only to drop out. all my effort. gone. i don't know. it just always seems like there's a wall in my way whenever i just want something for myself. 

i have a lot to do. a lot of decisions to make. a lot of people to please. but a lot of people who will never be satisfied. because what i do is never good enough as i always fall short, even though i put all i have and more for those who need me. 

it would just be nice to know i had someone like that for me, too. ",2

I want to recover from depression, but have an odd conundrum. I've been depressed all of my adult life and I worry if I get better from this, what if I do not like the new version of myself?

"Hey everyone! Quick little backstory: I am 22 years old and have suffered from depression since I was around age 14. During that time I took Zoloft with a Xanax PRN for panic attacks. Earlier this year (around May 2017) my primary doctor upped my dosage by 50mg, I was then taking 150mg. My body adjusted to the increase and I hated how it made me feel. I felt worse than before. As if it worsened my symptoms. So, full well knowing the dangers of stopping a medication like Zoloft, I stopped taking it around the end of July 2017. 

At first I was fine. Them a month had gone by and I was bad. Then a few months later (Nov 2017) I was the worst I had ever been in my life. I lost 20lbs from Thanksgiving to now... I don't have an appetite, even though I feel hungry all the time. I have extreme fatigue. I am always tired, no matter how much sleep I get. I am stressed because student loans kick in this month ($515 a month), and I cannot afford to visit my family doctor because of $ I owe from previous visits. 

Is this 20lb sudden weight loss something that can be attributed to depression? I am generally a very healthy person. I workout daily, but haven't been able to the past month because of my extreme fatigue and depression. That's why it confuses me as to why I've lost weight. 

I am 22, female, athletic build, 6'0"" and 178lbs.

"When I was a kid, I was severely bullied. Be we realized why, but I suppose because I could not defend myself and did respond to them with stupid answers, they would target me. When I was in high school, I had 2 friends who were exclusively school friends. They did not care to hang out of school and once school was over, we never saw each other again.

Now years later. Same story. I am not being bullied but people like to talk crap which is inevitable. So I invested time and money in this class. I was traveling somewhere far for it, my classmates were all friendly to me and joking around. Added each other on social media. This class happened to be a short-term one since the teacher was quitting. I thought these people would get close to me and since we were getting along, that they would like to keep in touch. So NOTHING! Again same story as back in high school. I happened to like this guy who did not like me in return and did things to hurt me such as not inviting me to the farewell class party or not asking me to get involved with projects out of class. Then they like each other's pictures on social media but not mine. Then I see some of them coming to my city to visit but they do not care to meet me and hang out.

So why people bother and act so friendly in class but not out of? Is it that they just want to be on good terms and earn something? Why go and act that me and them are friends and we can hang out but when I ask they are all busy? I admit I seemed a little needy. I did not put effort back in school to make friends but this time I did. I was polite, I did ask them about their goals, tried to be around and active, liked their posts on social media. Only thing is that I had a fight with the guy I liked and everyone liked him in class, so most likely he spoke nonsense. 

I just feel very disappointed. Any advice?",1
"Can't stop the negative thinking about how everything in my life is fucked up beyond repair. Through poor decisions and also situations and circumstances out of my control, I have zero future and no way of changing anything. 

I've become trapped in a cycle of chronic pain and depression/anxiety. It's hard to tell the difference anymore between whether one causes the other or vice versa. 

I can't work because of pain and crippling depression, but I've also been denied Social Security because I've been told that I'm not disabled enough or depressed enough to where I couldn't just shove pills in my mouth and do something--not that I want to be eternally damned to living on a fixed income. 

Things were supposed to be so different. I was on my way to a rewarding career and making damn good money, then everything crumbled, and I literally lost everything. All of my intelligence and good looks didn't do anything for my life against physically disabling conditions and chemical imbalances. 

Now I can't stop the carousel of shitty thoughts that just plays over and over in my head every day. 

I have zero friends anymore, I don't talk to my family, I don't work; honestly, I barely even leave my house. My shitty ex wife has done everything in her power to punish me and alienate me from my children after I could no longer care for them half time anymore after my injuries and spiral downward. 

Now my life is so small. I'm going insane from boredom and isolation and I get full blown panic attacks trying not to think about how everything is so fucked up and how I really can't fix it. 

I have bipolar II, PTSD, OCD, ADHD, and GAD.

My life is a shit show. I just want to run away and never come back but I can't actually run anymore. Lol. And I have no money. And I love my children too much to abandon them. My children keep me alive but also are part of the reason why I am so depressed and anxious about my life. Kind of fucked up in that way. 

I honestly don't know how to handle myself anymore. It's gotten to the point that I will literally just stare at my phone and lay in bed the entire day. I struggle to even put food in my mouth and when I do it's usually only so I can get drunk and not be as hungover.

I am 26, male, and I feel like my life is over. My family financially ruined me to the point where I feel like I shouldn't even bother trying to fix my life. Due to some circumstances I ended up moving to a town I hate living in, and can barely afford. It's in the american countryside. I hate the american countryside. I deeply hate it. I've never enjoyed myself in the country. I also don't drive, so that makes it suck more. That's just venting though. Some more venting, I've been financially supporting my parents for some years to the point of abuse. I've been saving up to buy a car the last year. 3 times I made it to about 3 grand. 3 times they've taken it, once my took it mom bought herself a car instead. Broke down 2 months later too. then her husband had a heart attack. Then they got themselves an eviction notice. I paid the entirety of their rent the last 2 months. I hate them. But. I can't drive, I have no savings, I am stuck in a place I hate living with people I hate living with and I afford it by working a job I hate and I can't do anything about it because I can't drive and I have no savings, no one will help me drive and my parents keep taking my savings.

I've disowned my family, aside from my mother but If by some miracle I save some money up and can leave, or she dies without leaving my homeless, then I'm done with her too. So. In my heart I've disowned my family and have no desire to ever contact anyone I share blood with for as long as I live. Which probably isn't very long.

I am completely isolated, very socially awkward, financially a failure. Well. Really I'm mostly just a failure. Like, in every way. I feel like I'm the biggest loser in the world. 

It really bothers me that I didn't do this to myself though. It would be so much better if I did this to myself, cause then I could stop it. Or I could at least take responsibility. I could have power, even if that power ruined my life it'd be mine. But. I go to work and then I basically give all my money to my mother cause she attacks and threatens me otherwise, I have no support system as I have no friends and no one that can and will actually help me, or offer a realistic answer to my problems. People offer shitty advice that has never worked. Staying positive does nothing for me. I can smile all day but It won't get me a car or put money in my pocket. No one I work with is really ""Friend"" material. I feel myself rapidly approaching 30 where ""friends"" become more irrelevant anyway. I feel like I'm going to die alone cause of it. Like, I'll never be allowed to fix up my life and meet someone. I'll never be allowed to save money. I'll never leave the american countryside that I hate living in oh so much. I really doubt I'll ever have sex again, at this point. 

I wake up everyday and the first thing I want to do is cry cause I hate being alive. Like life is a living hell, there's not a single thing about my life that is the way I actually would like. People tell me to take control without realizing I literally have none no matter how much I try, I can't be homeless cause I'd lose my job and there's no room in shelters cause they have to save so much space for women and they're at capacity with regulars. It's also winter, so I'd probably freeze to death in my area if I have to sleep outside. I want to die, but not like that. I also have no where else to go. Literally no where else. Not a single place in the world, as again, I have no friends or family. I have no power. I have no control. 

People offer advice completely ignorant of the fact that I have no resources. I can't leave the house under my own ability, I can't get up and go whenever to wherever. I also have no privacy when leaving the house cause of that. So outside of going to work I don't really leave. I feel like a prisoner. I have no power, I have no resources.

At this point I really think I should just kill myself. I'm rapidly approaching 30, I'm all alone in the world, I have no savings, my personality isn't anything anyone would enjoy at this point. I'm like broken and hollowed out. Just twisted up inside. I'm really no worthy catch in any department, as a friend or more. I often get told I'm handsome though. There's that. It's pretty worthless too. Like, girls I'm attracted too will tell me I'm attractive but my personality sucks too much for it to help. I get looks or fuck me eyes occasionally, no one really talks to me though. I was good with girls when I was younger. But. I had guy friends that would like, invite me along to places to meet women and then they started to kinda bash me and make me look bad. Like, I was bait, and a set up; so they could look good and get laid. So. That stopped. Then I self isolated. Then, I had to move. Then life isolated me. I'm in the middle of nowhere and every attempt at making friends has failed. Even meeting people in general, dating sites in my area don't have very many users. Only enough for like 3 pages in a search on POF. It's boring. I hate it. So, there's not a lot to choose from and it's already gone badly. So I'm alone. All alone. 

All alone, in a town I hate, with people I hate, wasting my time on a job I hate that doesn't actually benefit me cause I can't build up savings. I can't save up to drive. I can't save up to leave. I can't get my mother out of my life. I wake up and feel like crying. I feel like crying all day. I feel like crying now. It's like this every day. It's been like this for years now. So, waiting it out is not an option. This won't pass. It's not stopping. Nothings getting better, it's getting worse and worse. I really just can't anymore.

I think it's just time to go ahead and kill myself. I've really struggled and put in serious effort to fix my life, and it's not happening. I'm sick of assholes with bad advice and I am sick of trying.

I'm done. I am quite literally done, actually. This is the end of me.",2
"Hey all.  
Sorry if I seem like I'm just dumping a lot here, I just feel I need help thinking through some issues. 

The big thing is a pretty damaging vicious cycle. I'm awful depressed because I'm lonely and feel I'm the only guy my age (22) who hasn't dated anyone, or even had any close friends I could trust and talk to. Never really hung out with anyone. Though I wish to change that and make a few friends in college, but not only do I not know how to go about it even though it's my third year, but I just feel that nobody would care about me. In fact, everyone from high school completely forgot about me, even before graduation, and we're a small class and everyone knows everyone's name. 

There's a lot of things that drift through my mind when I try to work through this, and I just get overwhelmed.  

A number of things leave me feeling worthless about myself.  

I happen to be mildly autistic, which honestly I don't understand much about it, but in school, word spread about it and plenty of people started talking to me as though I was retarded, even a few that knew I was just like any of them. I should be able to just get over that, but... you can only wonder if people are telling you that you're intelligent and capable out of pity so many times before you start getting paranoid.  

Plus, I see tons of other people who seem to have good friends they're always hanging out with, but I never know how to introduce myself to someone, honestly I'm scared I'll make an ass of myself. Enough that I literally get paralyzed when I try to talk to someone, my jaw seizes up and everything. But I'm ok with people approaching me, which never seems to happen, it's only happened once in my life. This makes me think, is the easier problem to fix that I struggle starting conversations, or that nobody wants to talk to me? 

I've got pretty bad image issues, too... I know that it's almost impossible to find a guy who'll say it, but there it is. I won't say I'm a heavy guy, because I don't look particularly bulky, but I... look up gynecomastia and you got me. I look like I've got boobs, and yes I'm a man and *hell* no, I'm not trans. I've been trying to work out and loose them, but while I've been loosing some weight they're not really being affected. I'll never look good in a tee shirt like this, it seems, and that's kinda why I'm struggling to start an athletic lifestyle... again, vicious cycle I gotta break out of. 

Lots of things to work through here... I feel absolutely overwhelmed. ",1
"I'm not talking about our misconstrued constructs about what's morally acceptable. I'm talking about the hypocrisy and the pretentiousness, the megalomania that grips each and every person. I mean, everyone is so full of shit. We pretend to care about others, and want others to care about us, but it's not because we actually care. It's because we're the only thing that matters. As soon as it becomes convenient, we throw others to the side. So long as we can get our chemical fix, we'll slave away until the day we die, spouting bullshit and pretending as if things actually matter. Hell, we even have the ego to assume we have some kind of superiority over other living creatures. Are we not animals? Sorry, but just because we are subjectively more intelligent, doesn't mean our existence is any less futile or has any more meaning. Sorry to break it to you, but God's not real, and why would you even want him to be? (i may be inserting my preconceived notions as fact, but in theme with this post, Idgaf if you disagree) 
     On this subreddit, we all pretend to sympathize with each other, but I bet in real life we are all judgemental sacks of shit, and I'm willing to bet that because I know I certainly am. I like to spout about the woes of man, but in real life, I'm a slave to the emotional parts of my brain, an introvert with no social skills, humor, or personality. I don't explain this for pity btw, I explain this because I'm quite the hypocrite, and I'm willing to bet you are too. People who complain about gender inequality annoy me. People who complain about racial inequality annoy me. I'm a selfish prick, sure. But so are you. So stop forcing me to pretend to care about you? I have my own worthless ideals that I care about, and that you don't. For example, I think there is a ridiculous age inequality. For what reason should age be used as an indicator of expected respect? If you're a fucking idiot, and don't cater to my selfish wants, I'm not going to fucking respect you. I might be *age* and a know it all, but that doesn't guarantee I don't fucking know more than you. Even if I don't, everyone shouldn't just assume I don't and treat me like a fucking child, but then expect me to act like an adult. Are you fucking kidding me with the hypocrisy?
Oh, but even though you don't take my issue seriously, I should take racism seriously because it affects you personally and you would like to feed your ego.


I wasted enough time venting for no reason. Time to go waste my time working after staying up late for no reason. I don't really know what the point of this post was, but I feel like there was a general theme to it. I'm too tired to make a main point, all I know is that this post and every other post on here is effectively meaningless. ",1
"Tomorrow I will be going back to school. I am not looking forward to it in the slightest. To hear where and what my classmates have been doing during christmas and NYE, and having to worry about assignments and such. It's gonna be tough. But on the plus side, it will be my last year. Hopefully after that I get lots of time to try and get better. Maybe sooner if I fail. My grades have plummeted during the last year, but I try to not think about it too much. Chances are that my disability combined with my depression will render me unable to work, and I am very fortunate to live in a country where the disabled get financial aid.

Perhaps the NEET life will give me the time I need to find interests and develop a personality beyond that shy, crippled person with few words to spare. I will also hopefully get a driver's license this year or the next. I don't know what I will do with it, but it feels nice to know that I will be able to drive. I like the idea of driving around just for the sake of it. 

2017 was pretty shitty for me. At least in some areas. I had multiple suicide attempts, but none worked. I also had romantic feelings for someone, and I even had visions for a future with them. A happy future. I haven't had something like that in years. I even paid them a visit to meet in person. It was really exciting to travel abroad to meet an online friend. With that being said, we sort of fell apart shortly after I went home. Most likely a combination of my habit of shutting myself away when depressed, in addition to their depression. Maybe we will meet again sometime. 

I'm not really sure what to think about life anymore. I don't feel much sadness. Not like I used to. Just indifference towards everything. Like I don't care about anything anymore. I should be frightened to think that I tried to end my life. Sad that I split from my romantic interest without even a goodbye. Angry at myself for how I treat myself. But there is nothing. I feel like I've experienced what I need to experience. I've been happy. I've had friends. Moments of intense pain. Anger. Sadness. Depression and isolation. A connection to someone else like no other. I am satisfied.

I can die now. ",2
"I work at a convenience store and had a really rough morning. I'm been in a really bad depressive episode these past few weeks because the person I had feelings for cut me off. I walked into work today and immediately started crying in the break room and went to get on register and started sobbing. People were coming up asking if I was okay and I kept saying I was but I really wasn't. I was ringing people up just trying to wipe away the tears. I'd stop for a bit and then start crying again. Suicide has been on my mind a lot recently. I kept thinking about killing myself while I was at work, then I'd start crying while thinking of my mom's reaction after I kill myself. It hurts. I'm doing okay now. I had a few friends reach out to help me. Today has been a bad day. I don't even know what made it so bad.",3
"19 male America. I am in a worse place than ever before and not entirely sure of who or where I am so please excuse any nonsensical bits or typos. To put it simply enough, every thought, person, and location feels bizarre and unreal and detached and profoundly difficult and overwhelming. I feel like an alien life form who has been suddenly thrown into a human life and body, even though I've had 19 years of this existence. Or maybe I feel like nothing at all in an empty vessel others take for a human. Maybe that's a better way of putting it. I have been severely depressed and anxious as long as I can remember (I tried to throw myself in front of a car when I was 7), but this feeling is new. Am I dissociating? This morning (5 PM actually, morning for me) my dad, who I really like and respect and who has been as supportive as possible for me, came to wake me and I literally forgot for a moment who he was, who I was, and where I was. Although I had been invited to a party, I had spent New Year's Eve the night before alone, crying and thinking about death and viscerally shocking myself every moment, realizing I still existed. To get back to the point of this rant, the most basic things like material objects and gravity and other people feel apart from me and almost sinister. I dropped out of high school, got a GED, and failed or stopped attending two community college classes, all the while sporadically working three different jobs all of which I was fired from or quit after about two months. I've been talking to a few girls who seem very interested in me, but whenever it comes time to seal the deal or set a date, I just... don't. I don't know why. I'm just so tired of it all and I can't begin to imagine decades more of this life without having a panic attack. Last night I began writing my suicide note even without any particular plan in mind, but it felt cathartic, realer than anything I've experienced in years. I think I'd use sleeping pills. Other than that, music, which I listen to all the time, is my only anchor. Usually I only begin to feel alive when contemplating my death. At least I have control over that, and my memory would be viewed with rose tinted glasses, better than anything I could ever actually be. This post will probably be paid no attention because that's just how life goes for me, and that's not bait for attention. Whatever. At least I could put my thoughts down.",2

So, in Spain psychiatrist are expensive, i have to save a lot of money and see if that shit help, because i need fucking help.",3
"I used to be very close with my cousin and felt very protective of him. However, when we were teenagers we grew apart. My cousin is autistic but he always wanted to live independently. Anyway, he left his parents house and started working around the country (United States).

Unfortunately, he ended up living with a woman who had some sort of personality disorder. She was attracted to the fact that he was autistic and liked this vulnerability. When he eventually said that he wished to leave and move on, she tied him up and kept him as a prisoner basically. She would leave him long periods of the day (tied up so he couldn't escape) while she was out at work or shopping and then she used to come back and sexually assault him basically (he is essentially asexual so he didn't even know what was happening to him).

This would have continued for god knows how long until a neighbour found out what was happening and alerted the police.

She is now in prison and out of his life. However, he has been essentially sectioned for a while (because of the mental state he was in) and he is very upset by this as he has always resented his autism 'holding me back' and he wants to leave and start travelling across the United States again. This has lead to him becoming suicidal (which of course is not going to make the doctors want to release him).

I hate seeing him as a shadow of his former self but everytime I visit he asks me if I can help release him?

The problem is that he wants a lifestyle of travel and doing labour here and there. he is very hardworking that is no problem. However, his autism makes him vulnerable and he refuses to see this?

Anyone been in a similar situation?",3
"Um, so I'm 13 and I have depression and anxiety, but I'm only on medication for anxiety until I get my depression medication later.

So, recently, I feel like my depression has been making me dumber. I can't remember how to spell anything and I struggle to hear what people are trying to tell me and what it means.

"18 years old and have been depressed for almost 5 years now. My dream is to be a professional singer or actor. So many people tell me that the chances of making it is literally one in a million.

I look up to the musical artists and actors, and I always just wonder how they became who they are. I feel like there is no reason to continue living when what you want the most in life isn't there. Appreciate if someone read this and could give their input. Thanks",2
"So for the last year I've been suicidal and knew I needed to get help but couldn't afford it. I had an idea to ask my parents to use their health insurance since in still on it to get me to see someone, but was terrified to tell my mom her little boy was so broken. Well tonight I did it and cannot believe how understanding she was. Turns out depression runs in the family and she's been secretly seeing someone for years! 

For all those struggling - it's okay to ask for help. You deserve to be happy and if that means opening up about your struggles to loved ones, all the power to you!  I love you guys!",3
"So, here is my deal. Im successful. I am in great shape. I have a good life.

However, i have 0 self worth. 0 Self esteem. The worst. It's been this way for years.

**Backstory**
Severely abused as kid.  Then when i got out, I would over react to situations like a psycho. Extreme over the top protective responses to minor things.  I never hurt anyone, hit anyone, but was a hot emotional mess with how i handled things.  Learned to manage that with years of therapy.

Additionally, I would often find myself in relationships with women, who were horribly abusive and did some pretty shit things, further hurting my self esteem that i would allow my self to be treated like that.


So, i guess i feel since that I have allowed people to treat me as if i had 0 self worth for so long, that i feel like new great people wont possibly feel different. 

Additionally, I have alot of anxiety that alot of people may think I am crazy/emotionally unstable if tot hear of some of my situations in the past and i have stopped interacting with new people simply out of this fear.


i guess my difficulty, is that if i was overweight, I would feel like atleast i could put a plan into place where i could logically lose the weight and help me feel better.

however, i have maxed out everything that i can improve that way(body, finances).  I have to change the way my mind works and honestly, it seems impossible.

any thoughts/help/advice?",1
"**Looks :** Average  

**Personality :** Stone  

**Health :** Have to calculate what I eat in order to not rip my asshole apart  

**Studies :** Studying a long as fuck course with grueling hours. Regretting getting into it. But now no turning back. I'd enjoy it, or be less stressed about it if not for monstrous lecturers. Every morning I wake up thinking what will I get chewed out for today    

**Future :** Bleak. Specially job-wise. Relationships also have been forced so far, in my sad attempts to be a normal person. Marriage and kids don't look like its happening. In my culture this is undesirable. I'm the weirdo  

**Religion :**  Have to fake it. There is no freedom of religion where I am from. Sometimes normal people things make me feel conflicted. In the west its OK for casual sex, drinks etc. Here people do it too, even if they believe in God. Funny thing is, I'm the one with faith issues and yet I'm the one feeling guilty even thinking about these things.   

**Mentality :** I can't bring myself to compromise. I can't be happy if I can't make others happy or proud of me. But doing what makes me happy most likely would make people (family mostly) detest me.    

**Age :** Not getting any younger. Wasting my youth in pursuit of a grueling career. Never had any fun. People think I'm weird.

"hi everyone

I had been doing so well, I was a year and two months SH-clean. I was planning a tattoo to get that would cover all my old scars. 

but tonight brought on an depressive episode that Iâve never experienced before. on my way home, I was wailing/sobbing, talking out loud to myself about what was wrong with me, and then I had a thought that ceased the wailing and brought me to complete silence for the rest of the night. 

âIâm going to kill myself.â

When I got home, I got into comfortable pajamas and researched lethal doses of the medicines I have in my cabinet. I wrote out a note, telling my family and friends that I love them. 

I was nearly about to take the pills, when my cat came around the corner and started purring. She rubbed herself around my ankles, meowing at me happily. 

I broke down in tears, realizing what I was about to do. I later cut myself, which I justified to myself as being an âalternativeâ to suicide. 

Time to start the countup over. ",3
"My husband just left to take our dog to the dog park. He tried to get me to go but leaving the house just feels crushing. I was having an okay day. Itâs always a normal day until something small wedges itself in my brain and turns into the storm of anxiety. Weâve been married for a little over two months. 

Itâs time for me to find a job in my new location. I have a degree in Education, but it only took me my last semester to realize how I had made the biggest mistake of my life. When I was in my student teaching, I was teaching seniors (which was bad enough)- but then my mentor teacher bullied me and long story short- I absolutely donât want to teach anymore. I tried my absolute hardest but I guess I wasnât cut out for it. 

The last two years Iâve been substituting. It hasnât been the worst. Itâs an easy enough job. But I donât think I should be doing it. I feel like I need a better career. One I am cut out for. Besides, teachers always make fun of the person who claims to be a âprofessional substituteâ. I feel so depressed when I start looking at jobs. Itâs taxing to try and find something you can do when you donât know what you want to do. Before long into looking, I feel like Iâm just going to vomit. Now Iâm laying in bed- trying not to cry again and writing this Reddit post. This is such a fun way to go into the new year. Helpless and depressed. 

I donât expect anyone to comment and give me any sort of resolve, but I honestly just needed to vent this out because Iâm a pathetic human being.",2
"I got diagnosed with a pretty serious autoimmune disease about 5 months ago. The prognosis isn't great. I can take steroids and a few other drugs to halt the progress, but eventually, it's gonna destroy my stomach/GI tract. I might make it to 70, but that's not really realistic. All I know is that my life is going to be painful. It already is, but long term, it's just gonna get worse. 

For those of y'all with chronic illness, how do you deal with the knowledge that things are only going to get worse? How can you maintain hope when there really isn't any reason to have it?

"This past month has hit me like a freight train with red-hot spikes on the front. 

A while ago, I started hooking up with this guy. He's pretty cute, he's lively, outgoing, and funny. I started getting feelings for him, but I was afraid to tell him because I was afraid of getting hurt again. But life finds a way to hurt me anyways.

We hadn't talked in a while, and it made me feel like he was done with me. It sucked, but I knew it was going to happen eventually. Conveniently at this point, my ex hits me up. We start talking about how we're doing and politics (usually not good but we both enjoy talking about it), and then I noticed that he was getting....flirty?

Eventually he asked me if I wanted to be friends with benefits. Stupidly, I agreed, fully knowing that I still had strong feelings for him and never wanted him to break up with me in the first place. A couple days later (yesterday), we planned to meet up. The time came and went, and eventually I figured out that he went on first date with someone and was starting a relationship. That really hurt, and now I'm a mess. The whole year, I've been struggling with severe depression and anxiety, and now I get to know that I was so close to to getting him back but he's with someone else now.

The whole ordeal made me realize again that love is shit, and without love, life is shit. I can't move on from my ex, and even if I could, there's nobody else for me to move to. Except the guy that I hooked up with, *who also happens to be friends with my ex.* I hit him up last night anyways, because I'm so depressed that I don't even care. 

Life in general is terrible too. Relationship woes aside, I have one good friend, and nobody else. My brain is addled with mental disorders (autism, ocd, anxiety, depression, possibly borderline personality disorder). My grades in school are terrible because I've missed weeks of it. I can hardly form meaningful connections with anyone, and even when I do, they just leave me more hurt than I was before.

It's all just terrible, and I don't think I can handle it much longer. I want to live, and succeed, and be in a happy relationship with someone that loves me. But I don't think I can. I'm too broken. All that's keeping me here is my one friend, my own fear of taking myself out, and an infinitely tiny and naive glimmer of hope that I might find my way out of this and back into someone's loving arms.",3
"A little background about myself:I have always been struggling with depression, anxiety and self-worth issue. It was not always like this, I remember a time, about 15 years back when I was a confident and energetic child. But over the past 15 years I have been hurt and bullied to the point where i have lose any confidence i have in myself and have zero-self worth. Often being an entertainment for others, I just feel like my life is destined to be an entertainment for others, always there to bring happiness and joy to others at the expense of getting hurt myself.

First forward I am 20 years old now and have attempted sucide about 3 times, each time I was stopped. A few months back, I met this girl who was really amazing and we started talking and got quite close as friends. A few months ago I asked her for the opportunity to woo her and she say she will consider after I have touched her, nonetheless we continue chatting and we got so close to the point that we actually planned an overseas trip together for Christmas.

Fast forward to the trip, it was amazing and I (we) had a blast, however, on the last day, things started to take a turn for the worst. Her reply started getting very cold and she blocked me from her social. As we were staying in separate hotels I attempted to commit sucide again, only to be stopped by my friend who called the hotel and got the general manager to came up and stop me. 

Fast forward a few days from that, her reply to my messages has been nothing but cold, distant and it takes her hours to reply and that is if she ever reply at all. I really wondered what I did wrong. I tried asking her but she told me it was nothing and that she was just busy. But unfortunately, this has totally destroyed what ever little self-confidence and drive I have left and I just feel that I have suddenly plunged into darkness.

After 4 failed attempts I realise I'm too much of a wimp to do anything directly resulting in ending my life. I just want to stop existing as well. Today is New Year eve and I really just feel like wanting to just OD on pills and just hope I would never wake up tomorrow. Since for the most part of my life, everyone has been treating me as entertainment, I feel by doing this, I can present a finale to everybody, show everyone behind the fake smile that I has put on for so long....my friend scolded me for being so pathetic to put my happiness and life in the control of a girl but  for the past few months, my focus was only on her and I really enjoyed her company. I really donât know what happened and I really donât wanna lost this friendship, it is really ok if we donât get together but I do not want to lose this friendship as well.

I am really lost, really sad and really distant...I really donât know what to do anymore other than just not exist since I feel like a disappointment to everybody (average student, not much achievements, generally a disappointment) I use feel like lying down tonight and never waking up tomorrow.",1
"Iâm 21, Iâve ruined my credit, most of my friendships &amp, never had a real relationship. Iâm currently sitting in my room.... well actually my grandmothers room because of my recent eviction. My family has an extreme history of mental illness &amp; alcohol abuse so itâs not cand land here, itâs depressing as can be. I had already suffered from severe depression my whole life, now Iâm stuck in the middle of everyone elseâs illness again. My mom has schizophrenia &amp; was homeless cause she was scared to go in the house due to the government watching her. My aunt never gets up off the bed or takes showers or cleans her house and makes my grandmother (70) do everything including take care of her kids. The house Iâm currently in is filthy ( maggots in the carpet upstairs, chicken wings &amp; used toilet paper all over the bathroom, cat piss &amp; puke in the floor)cause I canât keep up cleaning it &amp; neither can my grandma. Iâve been trying to get my life together because I suffer from mental illness also &amp; im honestly such a failure, Iâm overweight, unmotivated, extremely irresponsible &amp; lazy and I donât know why because I want to achieve things in life buts itâs so hard with the situation Iâm in. I use to work when I lived on my own but now I live so far from the bus line &amp; itâs freezing cold so itâs hard finding a job. Sad thing is, I probably wouldnât keep the job anyway cause I suck at keeping one. I donât wanna be a bum but idk what is that my life is complete failure. Iâve tried therapy, medication but nothing is working. Do you have any type of advice???",3
"I am 25 soon and have been depressed since I was 15. I just can't see myself getting out of this mess. I used to think life would just ""work out"" as I got older but the truth is nothing has.

No dreams or goals. No pull in any direction. It's never changed. I hide my real self from everybody because I'd be labeled the sad guy if I did I make it known.

Like, what's the point of this cycle if all I end up feeling like is horrible and tired every day? I don't want this as a life.

My family don't know me, hell I don't even know me. I've got zero personality or character. Just a empty shell that plays a role.

Life is and has never appeared magical to me. I don't care about anything or anyone and I feel detached from society as a result.

I've done it all. Eaten a great diet, exercised daily, I don't drink or smoke or do drugs and yet my body hates me.

Sick of pretending. Money is everything and you are judged solely on your ability to make more of it.

I wouldn't wish this intense feeling of emptiness and loneliness on anybody. I want out.

I really don't know what to do. I've tried. Therapy, meds.

I hope I don't wake up soon. This life might not be for me.


How pathetic I'm telling strangers. Nobody else. I have nobody else.

EDIT - Ok so I honestly expected zero replies. I don't know what to say.
          I'd like to say I feel better but I don't. Thank you.",2
"Massive party at a friend's house- one of my closest friends is there, loads of of my close friends are there, i wasn't invited. wasn't told. only found out on snapchat from there stories.


spending new years eve on teamspeak muting my mic every time i break down :)",1
"tonight something strange happened. 

i was out with friends, we drank a little (i had about 3 drinks in 3-4 hrs) and when we left, we decided weâd go to the closest friendsâ house and continue to drink. i was by no means wasted.

out of no where my chest began to tighten and my heart started racing. at the last second, i asked to be dropped off at my parentsâ. i told my mom what happened and she suggested that it was an asthma attack. Iâve had asthma attacks, and this didnt feel like one (no wheezing/ out of breath)

it just feels like no matter how much i breath, i canât get enough air. and it also feels like my heart beat is extra loud? if that makes sense. also, itâs vey uncontrollable. there was no immediate stresser, but i have been stressed about life in general lately. like what iâm going to do in the future, a job, etc. 

the whole episode lasted half an hour or so.

i also get this feeling when laying in certain positions, being too hot, and feeling too constricted. none of these took place tonight, though. is this a panic or anxiety attack? does anyone else get this??

any help is appreciated :)

add on: the feeling is similar to as if someone were holding my heart and lungs in their hands, and slowly tightening their grip. not sure if that makes sense but itâs the best way i can think to describe it",3
"My family loves me. I'm only 17. I have a couple of close friends. I'm not broke, my house has heat, I have a Nintendo Switch. I laugh... 

I was fine until I saw this girl. ""Speak to her."" Hah! Thanks, but it's never so easy. She's plagued my mind, she's all I think about. She's destroying my mind and she doesn't even know me.

I see her every single day. All I do is dwell. Dwell she's not mine. It's my own fault. I'm the one who stays quiet. Well, she does too, of course, but I think you catch my drift.

I was fine. Now I'm not. I'm literally losing my fucking mind. Abusing disgusting amounts of various vile medications provided by my father's prescriptions. I've noticed a difference in my brain since I've touched those pills. I'm actually losing it.

Anxiety. Depression. Insanity. Bipolar. Lost in a pitch  black labyrinth called ""Life"". Therapist is nice but, talking about your fever won't cure it. Fuck Zoloft, Prozac, you name it, fuck it. My mind is becoming like a messy room.

On the verge of a noose. Is this the end? Is this life? Am I done for? We ask these questions. Redundancy.",1
"Hey, /r/Depression/ . I'm not sure whether I want to post here or in /r/SuicidalWatch/ as I'm having mixed feelings.

I'm from the type of people who pays attention to the detail, so let me give you some background. I'm a 19-y-o boy working as a waiter, which job was wrapped up by my grandmother. Yeah, living with my parents, and grandparents. I'm living in a very advanced level of poverty... even this is a miracle considering the chances, in my country, of being employed solely on a diploma.
This is the job I've started off after living 4 months of unemployment. I really f|cking prefer living my whole live unemployed, rather than being employed in such a sh|tty job. ""Why don't you just change your job? Or the very least, change the workplace?"" It's not as simple as that. No one hires. This just as in, because you really do need a good certification or degree from (preferably) the... richest... places. E.g. Microsoft certification, or an Oxford degree.
Now let me tell you about the job I'm stuck on working. Every. goddamn. day. And I'm almost wanting to cry typing this, because it only reminds me of what I'll have to face tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and et cetera. I don't like my job, because co-workers, I don't like the F&amp;B Manager (Food and Bar Manager), I don't like the boss, and the clients, towards which I force myself to have positive feelings, because I'm a waiter, and this is a positive, and a default trait.
I'm an outsider working with not-so-intelligent co-workers, but very experienced in the field. It's because I'm new and know nothing about this genre. No one teaches me anything regarding how to work, and how to work the work. When I try to do something on my own, I usually fail, because no one offers a hand (referred as to teaching), then the staff of the whole hotel (the workplace) gather togheter, talking to each other that I'm incompetent, I'm stupid, they laugh at me, and feel a relief telling me ""You aren't good for anything. Better quit this job as soon as you can. It's the same even if you're working. You're only causing troubles, and issues."" 
A usual worker would think, ""Well, it's not an estimation by a manager."" But the thing is, my co-workers are very close with the manager, and always whine to him how I'm not good for anything. If I try to 'raise my voice' (figuratively), I always get a huge backlash of bullshit. I.e. there has been a problem, and I'm not in fault, but if it is in correlation with the experienced co-workers, it usually is my fault. Kind of a handicap. It got to a point where my manager cuts a lot of tasks, duties, and obligations, because I'm 'incompetent'. Today he saw me trying to carry 2 things at once, and got irritated, then told me by a very unpleased voice and body language 'Just stop trying to multi-task.' But I usually am good in multi-tasking, but the cowardice feeling (anxiety closy-by [It's really not anxiety, but I really do get VERY scared]) of having someone around me that watches what I'm doing, and probably expects the failure. And it really increases the chance of failure.
I really do have a friend of mine in the staff, but this can't really compensate anything. I have (had) friends, with which I've lost contact long time ago, and basically what I'm doing in life currently is go home, sleep, and to work again.

[#The Having Positive Feelings Towards Thoughts Of Death]
I usually watch entertaining or educational videos, which I've watched before, but the difference is that now I don't feel anything. I just feel depression, which cannot leave me. When watching utensils, I get a little uplifting feeling, which is caused by thoughts of harming myself. I really can't do anything about it, nor can you. The premise is that I want to get A LOT of weight off of my burden.

This is the life I'm living. Handicapped. It literally feels like you're tied, and can do nothing else, but to accept hard hits. Thank you for paying attention... not even the guests of the hotel are That merciful.",1
"I thought there was a small chance that I might get invited to make plans by old friends, but I should have known that wasn't gonna happen due to persisting false rumors. Now I'm stuck in my room just sad and depressed. I am 21 though, so I'm wondering if I should just go to the bar and drink a bit so at least I'm surrounded by people when the new year starts. I'm hopeful for the future, but rn I'm down as hell. I try to look my best all the time but my nerdy demeanor and social anxiety kills any interest someone might have towards me. Idk what to do.",1
I don't want to kill myself but what am I here for.  I don't really add anything.  I just exist to buy things basically.  I'm not needed yet I was born and want to exist.  I'm not smart enough to make a difference yet here I am.  Dull job consuming like a good slave.,2
"Well let me very quickly introduce you to my pathetic life.

I'm 23, been in school from Fall 2012 - spring 2017. I started to have serious depression and suicidal thoughts in 2013. I have no friends, never been in a relationship. I've never had a job. Live at home etc etc. I'm a failure. 

I took a semester break in Fall 2017 because my GPA fell pretty low (2.1) and I have no motivation to continue school. I hate it so much. I'm wasting my parent's money. I haven't been doing well in school for a while and have taken less and less courses each semester since 2014. I hate myself for doing this.

So anyways in the fall of 2017 all I could've taken at my uni would be electives because I failed a pre-requisite only offered in summer/spring. The next wave of courses were kinda ""locked"" behind this pre-requisite. It felt meaningless to stack up on electives. My parents let me take the semester off to take some online courses not at a ""real"" university, but more of an online training program. It's alot cheaper than my normal university.

It's like a online thing where you get training from industry professionals in the games industry. During my time at uni I discovered modding and game development and found that I got pretty decent at it. I've been taking it really seriously since 2015. It's my dream to do it professionally one day. Yes, I know that is probably already making you cringe. I've been trying to build up a portfolio for a while and I feel like this is the first year where I've made some real progress. The courses I took where way above my skill level so I wasn't able to get the ""certificate"" but I learned way more and felt more excited about my life than I have in a while. I really think I can get atleast a remote job if I work hard enough this year. I know you can learn alot on your own, and I'm all for that usually. It's honestly been really helpful to get direct feedback from the instructors and I've learned workflows and really specific techniques that I don't feel I couldn't learned on my own. It feels like it gave my life a sense of purpose. 

Anyways, I told my parents I would go back to University after this one semester off but I don't think I can. The thought of going back makes me feel suicidal. Like it honestly feels if I go back I will end up hurting myself. I hate saying that but it feels so true.

Instead I want to spend another semester doing some more of these ""other"" courses I talked about to keep building up my portfolio. Is it a terrible idea to keep pursuing this portfolio thing? (instead of going to proper uni). I'd effectively be dropping out of college. I could always go back though, I'm not on academic probation (yet), and I wouldn't have to reapply for re-admission if I went back in the summer. I feel like it's unlikely I'll ever go back though.

I really want to do it but I think my parents would be incredibly against it. I'm going to talk about it tomorrow with them. If I'm going to sign up for classes at my normal uni I have to do so by Jan. 9. Even just opening up the University website made me start shaking and my breathing got really heavy. I really don't think I can go back.

So, am I an idiot for wanting to take more of these game development courses rather than going to proper university? Is this a terrible idea? I don't know what to do really, I feel like I'm just stuck and going nowhere in life.

"is this a depression thing? is this a medication thing? (i'm on lamictal, lexapro and seroquel).

i noticed that my dreams are very intense and vivid and i remember them with much more detail than before, also I wake up a lot more in the middle of the night.",3
I'm still able to do daily tasks but my minds  all ways blank when I do them when I do think it's usually a long thought about deppressing stuff or it's quick thoughts. Sometimes I get the urge to choke myself with my hands and one time I scratched myself very hard and the next day a scab formed where I scratched. I don't feel depressed except when I have long thoughts but I know when your depressed you sometimes don't feel anything.,3
"When I was around 10 my mom was babysitting kids and we went outside to play. When we were playing we ended up using the hose and for some odd reason I told my friend to hold the hose so it wouldn't squirt water and I put my face over it and he let go and i angrily threw a plastic play toy at him ( a light toy ). My mom became instantly angry. She started saying come here in a angry voice and I ran across the yard. Surprisingly she didn't come get me. Long story short I ran in the house went under the couch and hid. My mom rang the phone to my dad and he answered my mom whose was screaming because she couldn't find me. She found me and grabbed me and I kept yelling ""god please help."" And she put her knees on my arm and grabbed a pillow and put it over my face. But then she let go and told me to go down stairs. She told me how much I was a mistake and how she hated me and doesn't love me.

I still remember that day like it was yesterday. I tried killing myself 3times this month because I think about it everyday. I don't know what to do because it emotionally scared me. Can some one please help me.",1
"I suspect that what I'm dealing with is a mixture of anxiety and depression, but I haven't been to talk to anyone yet. I'm a college student and plan to see one of the psychologists on-campus after they reopen for spring semester. Anyway, I've been dealing with a lot of issues of feeling alone, sad, and generally hating myself. Not all the time...but enough for it to be an issue. I only talk to my boyfriend because he's the only one I trust. I have one friend but we aren't close enough to discuss ""real"" issues. My anxiety stems from having a chronic illness and being sexually abused in a past relationship, on top of a lot of general social anxiety. A lot of my ""depression"" (I say that in quotes because I'm not sure if that's what it is yet) is self-defeating. I frequently find my mind telling me that I'm worthless, even though I logically know it isn't true. There have even been times when I'm home alone and force myself to go somewhere because 1)I'm too miserable in my own head and 2)I'm afraid I'll succomb to hurting (NOT killing) myself if I'm alone with my own thoughts. I've just been struggling a lot lately and wondered if anyone has similar experiences and has gotten through it. I am going to see someone, and I'm contemplating Zoloft. Not as a real fix, but just something to help me dig out of this hole I'm in right now. Sorry this was so long, just a lot of thoughts to shuffle through! ",1
"I had someone I barely know trying to offer advice last night. He's one of those ""you should go seek help"" types. No shit - wouldn't that be nice? 

I *did* when I had the ""luxury"" of health insurance. I'm on my own now, though, and am doing my fucking best. 

It felt like it came out of nowhere, too, when he initiated the call and wanted to hear me participate more in voice with group chats. I'd made jokes about needing time to remember how to speak after so much tension with family, and think he may have gotten the wrong impression. He started offering new employment routes, which, while appreciated, also just overwhelmed me even more. I'd already told him that I technically have two businesses, one teaching guitar and the other gardening. He was offering stuff completely unrelated and out of my field. I'd like to look into them, but I have multiple learning disabilities and mental illnesses over here. It's gonna take time 

I would like to talk to him more about it, but felt I needed to rant and hopefully clear my head. If anyone has suggestions, I would truly appreciate it 

Also, happy new year:)",3
"I met my first girlfriend in high school, and I fell hard. She was smart, confident, gutsy, and the first person I felt comfortable talking about my kinks. She did not do anything half-assed, everything she touched she put her energy into. We were both in tech and had startup dreams. She had to run away from an abusive parent, and ended up staying at my place for a time. I thought we had a genuine connection. But she kept comparing me to her other ex, saying that he left her with high standards. Then she started college and first week she dumps me for a startup hotshot, saying she was tired of waiting for me to improve myself. 

So college came around for me, and I hyped myself up. I was going to work hard, play hard, and have a bunch of sex and meet my next girlfriend and future wife. I was going to meet my cofounder and start a cool company. But none of that really happened. Mechanical engineering was tough and ate up most of my socializing/free time. I was in a new city where I knew zero people. I fell into a rut and dropped out.

Additionally, I started thinking my current friends and family were boring, and I started distancing myself from them. In retrospect I was too harsh judging them; nevertheless I still feel disconnected from them.

I know Itâs bad to not compare myself to her, but my imagination still runs wild. I cut out Facebook, Twitter, and blocked her out of my life, but I still cannot stop comparing myself to her. She is smart and got an internship for a big tech company right into college, and was getting featured in the local paper. She got invited to tech events and parties.

Itâs been three years and my self esteem never recovered. I feel Iâve let myself down, not finding a girlfriend and screwing up with engineering. Online dating/hookups didnât work. The sexual frustration sucks. I donât want to waste away my twenties being single. I thought about hurting myself, but after sleeping on it I realize that will do no good. 

Iâm in a mental stalemate: Iâve cut her out of my life, but I still have low self esteem. I see-saw in between being whiny about myself, and angrily wanting to punch every couple in the street. Iâve tried three different therapists to little improvement, and my mopey-ness is straining my relationship with my dad. 

Things are getting better at a glacial pace, but that feeling of failure still clouts my mind. Iâve binged many articles/videos (DFW, Alan Watts, School of Life, etc.), started going to sleep earlier, and started journaling. However, the feeling of failure still affects my day-to-day where I can barely keep my job. I still get discouraged on even the most minor of challenges.

"Every time I type something up here I think of all the times I've been psychologically tortured by ""friends"" and just people online to the point of it being more harmful than my own mental illnesses that I get scared.

Tonight I'm not scared.

It's been tough since November. TLDR: A friend of mine rapidly fell ill and has cancer - three tumors in his kidney which is the primary cancer and two tumors in his brain. Anyone who's familiar with stage 4 brain cancer knows how this ends. Best friend of 15 years cut off from me after I admitted to them I was diagnosed last week with Aspergers. Same friend has had my back through my mental health issues (bipolar, several anxiety disorders, anorexia, alcoholism) and somehow bails for autism?

I thought I couldn't feel lower until I was the one hearing about a NYE party I wasn't invited to by my other friend. Three friends and two are treating me like shit (or I'm over analysing, I don't know) and one's dying. I've been too sick with walking pneumonia to be able to see them in hospital.

I don't know what to do. I've been emotionally blunted/numb since August (physical inability to cry) as well as skills from years of CBT, DBT and CPT aren't really doing much. I feel like shit. I was the only one online on PSN tonight, the only one playing WoW and I can't focus on Netflix. I feel like a fucking loser and wonder why I'm always alone. It's not JUST because I'm sober, people still can hang out without drinking, but every year I'm alone. I was alone on Christmas. I was alone on Thanksgiving. I can't go out to Tim Hortons (my usual place to be to write and journal) because it's -37C and that's just not happening.

I don't know what the hell I want out of posting here, I've just found myself at this sub reddit more and more and I guess tonight I needed to get this off of my chest. Lord knows if I do it on FB someone will call the police again for a wellness check (despite knowing I 1) have a safety plan with my therapist I see weekly and 2) have been known IN THE PAST to get myself to the psych ER when I'm feeling low enough) or accuse me of drama or something else.

I don't know. Fuck the holidays, fuck new years and I wish I had friends who cared. Everyone I've ever tried to meet online or in any of my games either turned out to be transphobic, homophobic and absolutely psychotic the second I refused their advances. I just want fucking conversation where someone's end game isn't to get laid (I'm asexual so good luck bruh) or treat me like a piece of shit.",3
"Maybe this will help someone or help me. Iâm not quite sure. Iâm a 24 m with three kids. Iâm going to back up and let everyone understand.

  When I was about 1 year old my father obtained full custody of me. I rarely seen my mother. Once in elementary school she came around once a month. My dad was always hauling me around. Pretty much raised me just fine as a single father. He got married when I was 12 and sheâs an alcoholic who is also a feminist. She was just that, a person married to my father. About 16 years old, towards the end I ended up getting a girl Iâd been in a relationship with for a year pregnant. I attempted suicide as all I have done in my life is alcohol and drugs. Very foolish and ignorant and didnât understand life. (I get it, selfish or whatever roast me later.) 
  We split because she had a very dark personality. She eventually got addicted to heroin. Which leads to my next venture at 18-20. I met a girl who was supposed to be a one night stand. Iâd have barely held a job and was completely irresponsible. We had shared parenting of my oldest son. I was also in school and decided I wanted to be a firefighter. I took my EMT class and got a job working on an ambulance. She accidentally got pregnant with me because of a failed nuvaring.She was very controlling of me and which I hated the feeling of being controlled. As I had been a free spirit for pretty my entire life. I was staying at home by myself since I was about 6 years old.
  I ended up cheating on her when he was about 8 months old.Ew ah, bad guy. Immaturity at its complete and utter finest.  Understood. But wait there is more! I woke up late for work which I shouldâve been there at 4 a.m after I got home at around midnight from college classes. I lost my job and ended up failing my paramedic class by about .5% which meant I couldnât go forward. So, I dropped out of college and lost my job. My parents let me move back in with them. I worked at papa johns just for a little money. Then came the first child support order. 
  Making barely 500$ every two weeks as a manager they decided to hit me as hard as they could with $200 a month. Not too bad but I couldnât afford to live on my own. *queue sappy music* I decided to get back into working on the ambulance. I was disgusted of not making enough to live on my own. I took out about 20k student loans as well to buy the ex and nice 4.5k explorer. As well made sure we had everything we needed. As well as a car for me! Debt debt debt. I made less money working on the ambulance coming in at a whopping 8.57$ an hour. I worked about 80-120 hours a week. Straight 24âs day after day. I found different girls to be with because I still couldnât afford to live because I only made around 1,200$ a month. We then found out my ex was addicted to heroin. We had shared parenting so the only way to remove the order without lawyer fees was to give my parents temporary custody.
  Alright, so at this point youâre probably like damn it canât get that bad. As Billie mays says, âbut wait thereâs more!!â Oh boy I reflect on life a bunch. I accrued 3 credit cards which are completely maxed. Heheheh. So on the with story, I met a few different girls and they all had decent jobs which let me have my own place to stay. (Crowd yells:gold digger!!) It was at this time I decided the current girl was not cutting what I needed. Boom, break up with her, at the same time I found a new ambulance job which gave me a 1.50ish raise. Heâll yeah. So at this point I donât have any custody of my 2 kids and my parents were so gracious to take a child support order on me. (Since Iâm making money, ya know 8.57$ an hour.) broke up with her and 3 weeks later she calls me to tell me sheâs pregnant.(oh god dude you havenât learned your lesson.) ((Iâm 23 at this time.)) 

  I said I have nothing with my first two kids and barely see them. I work for nothing and I think the best option would be abortion or adoption. Around the same time I got that new job guess what? Child support claimed I made 15$ an hour and raised my child support to all intensive purposes to about 485$. My other order was recalculated at 8.57$ less than two weeks later as well saying the first order was at 200$. So the girl hits me with the, literally, fuck you pay me.

  Thatâs nice. I said screw it major life change. I need it, something. I found my girlfriend through a friend on Xbox live, whatâre the freaking odds? I worked on an ambulance but they wouldâve taken half of every check which made the 15$ a day render pointless as Iâd only be making enough to go back and forth to work. Well, of course I get a massive 315$ order. Weâre up to 1100$ ish a month on barely above minimum wage. Now, did contracting work for my dad because I couldnât make any money no matter what to pay bills. Hey, arrears!! You said fuck your kids so weâre going to fuck you!! Oh.. is that what happened.. I found a blessing of a job making 18$ an hour. Not doing my career because I cannot afford it. Iâve been working overtime since 18. Practically killing myself to make ends meet. I am now forced to work on the road. I have to work overtime if I want to pay bills and eat food. Even then I still donât make enough. I havenât paid any debt off. Iâm about 28 grand in debt. Iâve had both my 2 kids taken from me. I didnât have a car for 6 months so I had to borrow my dads truck which he took back. My co-worker sold me a car for 500$. Good guy. 

  Now weâre here. Today, almost the start of a new year. Everything, anything, Iâve ever cared about has been taken from me. My kids. My career. My money. My life. My girlfriend gets mad at me because I can be insecure. What she doesnât see is Iâm holding on.. Iâm afraid to lose anything else.. not afraid.. Iâve lost motivation. Iâve found god. Iâve gained motivation. Spurts. Iâm strong. I have to be. At 24 I act like Iâm 45. Maybe 55 because Iâm tired. I work 40 hours of overtime 7 am-11pm of hard labor when there is work. Most of the time there is not. So average of 40 hours. If I get a second job Iâll get jumped by child support. Already happened. Seen a counselor to try getting prescribed adderall because my body is falling apart. My mind is blank. My thought process is almost gone. I can barely do the dishes correctly. My mother has taken herself away from me. My children have been taken away. He said Iâm strong not depressed. I canât even afford healthcare. I make too much as a âsingle guyâ to get Medicaid or the food card. I canât get legal aid. I owe tax money too because I claim 2 for 1 person. They are trying to take my tax return that doesnât exist either.

"I'm currently going through some hard times and have no emotion towards it. I have ME (mialgic ensephilomitis), ME makes you become very tired very quickly to the extent that at times it even inhibits the ability to properly think. I have other issues but that's the main one. it first started in the middle of my freshman year, I'm now a junior. Because of it my doctors have removed me from any school and I'm to tired to do most things. This has made it as if I have been frozen in time while the rest of world continues forward without me. At first this was heartbreaking and I went through depression, however during that time I always thought that my emotions were not nearly as strong as a normal person's would be in this situation. Since then I have stoped being depressed but have also stopped feeling emotion towards my situation completely, both positive, negative and even neutral emotions, I just don't feel. I have also started finding it very difficult if not downright impossible to feel empathy towards others, or any other emotion for that matter and I have been left with only  logical reasoning -when I have the energy to properly think- to an extent. So I am wondering if my lack of emotion is normal or not? Is there anything I can do about it because it feels very unnatural.",2
"So I have been effed up in life several times. I've got quite a background with depression , rejection and bullying. I'm 21 and I feel like my life is already doomed, like there is no way out of this.

I've been struggling with paradoxical feelings, because I met a girl who I've fallen in love with, but she has bpd and got a full time job. We rarely speak now, only in March will she be available again. She makes me feel good about myself, like the only thing that truly makes me happy. I care about her so much, so I am letting her set her life straight and not talk to her. She's rarely in the mood anyways, as she gets home too tired to talk or too depressed. She told me she loves me, but she's not ready for a relationship yet. I'd love to heal her and make her happy, regardless of being in a relationship with her or not. I just want her to be happy. That alone, would make things better.

I struggle with some kind of mental illness. I can't say what it is, since I've never been diagnosed. I believe, however that I have depression and/ or avpd.

Also, she lives in another country and I'm scared that if I meet her in person, things will change. Like, she will stop liking me. I'm very awkward in real life and can't express a fourth of what I write.

I'm scared of completely deliver my heart to her, although I do trust her. But, I just have a feeling that she may not want it, since she mentioned she's not ready for a relationship yet.

She's been with abusive exes and has a rough past, which is no wonder she is trying to protect herself.

So what should I do? We are both afraid, but we love each other. We are planning to eventually meet up one day. But that is what scares us. We are afraid of hurting each other and being hurt. Maybe because it may won't work out, not because we would actually hurt each other.

She's my everything. This is the first time I felt such strong feelings. I am numb on the inside, but when I am with her, all my demons fade away.

It frustrates me being so useless to her. I want to do something for her, but she's been to busy. We haven't spoken in more than a week. It will probably carry on till March or something.

I've been severely depressed. Talking to close friends helps a bit, but my closest friends are online friends. My real life friends are not that close and I don't feel comfortable with them.

The darkest thoughts have been running through my mind, and I've been idealizing suicide lately. The only thing that keeps me from doing it is that I have family who loves me, and I have online friends who are also family to me. If I ever did it, they would not know about it, I'd just become inactive forever, and that would certainly pain them more than my family since they would not know if I was dead or not.

Even so, I don't know how long I'll last. Don't mean to be pessimistic, but things aren't looking okay. I feel like my feelings don't make sense and that my thoughts are too confusing. It's becoming unbearable ",1
"I like absolutely *nothing* about myself. My brain is defective, beyond a point where I'd be willing to try to do anything about it. And every day I have fantasies about ending all of it. I'm getting tired of other humans' bullshit. I'm getting tired of my own. It just doesn't feel worth it and I really want to die. ",3
"My adventure with depression started at start of middle school. I went to new school with many thugs. I am a quiet, peaceful, so I was bullied harshly - like throwing lit matches at me, laughing at my acne, once whole gym with 70 people laughed, because I couldn't make a simple exercise, dog barked when we were coming back from school and they said ""Even dog doesn't like you"". To add fuel to the fire, when I came back home parents were screaming at each other, because of my alcoholic father and financial problems. I was totally alone with all the problems and it seemed like whole world is against me.

After few months I changed school with ""normal"" people not thugs. However something changed in me. The world was dark, I had negative thoughts about myself, world and others 24/7 like ""I am worthless"", ""People are evil and want to use me"", ""People are suffering around the world"". I had nightmares everynight like I was holding injured man on apocalyptic landscape and there was an atomic alarm, on the sky there was a sign ""magnetic field can kill you"" then I woke up screaming, but the real world looked like in this nightmare. There was no escape. At start I fought with it, but after a while I accepted this dark world. I watched dark movies, listened to dark ambient etc. This lasted 6 years. I tried many SSRI's, but nothing worked. 

At the end of high school I started experimenting with dissociatives like ketamine. They helped me a little, but at the end of school I tried to commit suicide and was sent again to psychiatrist. He gave me venlafaxine and it was miracle. It changed my world in 30 minutes, color started to be brighter, mental pain wasn't there, no negative thoughts, doing things started to be pleasurable again. I mixed it with dissociatives, because there are studies linking ketamine as useful with depression treatment. Now, after 3 years I don't use ketamine or SSRI's and my world looks like heaven. I feel good all the time, no negative thoughts, have motivation to do things, colors are bright, no nightmares, normal self-esteem (while in depression I thought that I was a complete shit and shouldn't even breath, because of waste of oxygen). I want to say to you, that there is a hope.",1
"I hate that you have no defense when someone disagrees with you. ""It's your depression talking."" No, shithead, maybe you're treating me like crap and I have a legitimate reason to be unhappy about that. Except you have to defend that because the immediate assumption is you being negative - and you're not even sure yourself. You practically help them gaslight you.

I hate that the only people who talk to you are miserable failures like yourself, talking about being miserable failures. What you need is a way out of hell, not more company there. And most functional people either don't know what the hell is like, or having left, can't go near it for fear of being dragged back. I know I wouldn't want to.

I hate that it fills you with so much energy and takes away any ability to release it.

I hate that your choices with most new people are to be a non-entity, or a drain on their energy because they have to deal with you.

I hate that for most of the medications I've tried anyway, it doesn't take away the sad, it merely allows you to function through it. Even if it does, it ultimately isn't enough if you don't have at least a bit of genuine happiness to hold on to.

I hate that you start to despise the coping mechanisms that you develop. You're in a world of swimmers and you aren't even treading water; you're drownproofing.

My family just thinks its something I can just not think about and it will go away. I find it impossible to tell my family in words how I truly feel everyday. It seems like they just see it as laziness, even though there's nothing I wouldn't do to feel 'normal' one day. Spending all my days on the break of crying, truly is miserable regardless if everyone thinks it's made up or an excuse for not being proactive(I've heard it all).

"Like right now, I just got up. I need to feed my pets, clean the litter box, brush my teeth, start some laundry, and eat something. It feels like too much. I'm so anxious right now, and I just want to go back to bed and shut down. I don't care about today. I don't want it. 

But if I get it all done, I'll probably feel okay. That's not the case every day, but today I feel like I could get to a good place if I try. 

But then what? Tomorrow starts the same way. Too much to do. Everything's too hard and I feel sh!tty. Until I get some things done and the weight is lifted. 

Heck, even two hours from now I'll be in the same boat. There's always stuff to do. I need to clean the house, make some phone calls, shovel snow, get dressed, eat again. It never stops. 

And sometimes I can feel good when I've gotten somewhat on top of things, but what's the point? It's like an endless wild goose chase. Shouldn't I be able to just feel good, regardless of the conditions around me or what's on my to-do list? 

Also, this is just basic stuff. I don't have any kids, relationships to manage, projects or hobbies, and only about 20 hours of work a week. I'm just trying to keep myself and my animals from starving or dying from poverty, filth, or negligence. And it's so hard. 

I'm going to go do that list of morning stuff, because at least it'll keep things from getting worse. But I just wish it didn't feel so futile.",2
"In all shortness I just moved and tomorrow at noon I gotta hand in the keys for the old flat, but here I am on the floor in my old flat and have yet to empty all the cupboards in the kitchen and do all the cleaning.

There's at least one large car load worth of things to move and I havent got a car or a license - so cant even rent a car and get it done. First I thought to walk with things (only moved a few blocks), like I have already done two times, but it's notably difficult to do so (and since it's getting late I'm contemplating a taxi. One can use a taxi for this, right?).

I've had months to get this all done but of course here I am having procrastinated like hell and dealt with anxiety by knocking myself out cold to sleep. And since the support system is 99% parents I keep silent about this and dont wanna bother them more than this move already has. So yet again I've put myself in an utterly idiotic position of misery.

Tomorrow comes with work again but I am honestly contemplating calling in sick and dealing with this shit between morning and noon instead of now (been here all day and it is now late evening).

Another sad part is that today has actually been a very productive day compared to what I normally pull off.

And this just sucks. Landing myself in this position sucks, getting myself out of this position sucks. When it's done and over with it will still suck.

So I can feel horrible for a whole month but after feel like I'm on top of the world for a bit. One of the sad realizations of 2017 for me is realizing that there are a lot more people who suffer from depression than I thought. I'm starting to build a good support group of friends and family when things get tough, but I haven't felt there are too many groups (to my knowledge) to talk about depression, except here. Are there any sort of discord groups or anything like that that focus on depression? Maybe even YouTubers that talk about their problems with depression. Sometimes depression hits me at the worst times, so there are times where I can't really talk to people for a bit because everyone could be at work or asleep. I think it would be cool to have a place to go to to talk with like minded people that is maybe a little faster than making a reddit post. I hope I can become active in this community as well.

"Hello!
This is my first post on Reddit. English is not my native tongue so bare with me.

My mom and dad molested me from 0-18 years old. My dad got me pregnant at the age of 11. We went abroad and I had an abortion. When I was younger (before I hit puberty) they sold me to other men and allowed them to use me as they pleased for a night, sometimes a whole weekend. 

At 18 I got a good job and moved far away from them. Now I'm 23 and my life is very good. I married the man of my dreams and together we have a 1 year old kid. I know I should be happy but I always feel depressed and anxious. I have flashbacks everyday and nightmares every night. 

I'm starting a ptsd program with a therapist tomorrow and to be honest I don't want to go - I'm really scared. I don't know what will happen when I start talking about everything that happened when I was a kid.
I feel like my childhood was just too messed up and I will never get over it. I'm so tired of the flashbacks and the nightmares. I have too many bad memories. I don't want to live like this, I can't live like this. 

Do you think I can get over this and be normal?

"Hey guys,

I'm hoping someone could shed some light on a situation for me.
I have been diagnosed with major depression disorder and an anxiety disorder. I have been suffering from.bith severe depression and severe anxiety for about 9 months and after trying numerous things to resolve it (including self medicating) I had finally decided to give medication a try.

At first I was put on citalopram, this caused many severe side effects like increased anxiety, insomnia, constantly sweating, nausea, dry mouth etc. But I had a period where for 2 days I had worsening of depressive symptoms, suicidal thoughts and very impulsive - like - uncontrollable anxiety (with constant shaking for 2 days straight). I visited my doctor as this frightened me and immediately switched my medication to effexor. 

I recall before that episode had happened I had binged on counterfeit oxy and counterfeit Xanax (two pills I have been self medicating with as it's the only thing that helps me feel ""good""). I of course didn't bring this up to my doctor and I am now wondering is it possible that the drugs used to self medicate might be causing alternative effects with the antidepressants?

The effexor seems to be a better fit for me as I didn't have many side effects but I still had a similar episode I had before. It all starts with a painful headache, then horrible thoughts and followed by uncontrollable anxiety that doesn't seem to die down. I remember I self medicated the second time in hopes it would stop the episode but that either didn't work or made it worse.

Does anyone have any insight on this they could share?",3
"Back in school the only time I would get attention is if someone wants me to do something, or for bullying me. In highschool and college I find everyone just ignores me.

In class I see people socializing all the time but no one has ever, ever talked to me. I guess I'm just really ugly. I wish I could be attractive so I could get some attention for once. Any ""friends"" I made in college turn out to be fake fucks who only need me for helping them with assignments or some other crap.

Edit: Well what did I say",1
"I grew up being raped and molested by my step dad from age 5 to 11 and once by an uncle at age 7. I have witnessed 7 suicides in my life, 4 of them infront of me and the others I walked in on after it was done. I have been beaten daily till I was bleeding or my step dad got tired of hitting me from age 5 to 17. I was homeless from 18 to 27, I never knew my real dad but for a few months before he died of liver failure, I was 23, then at 25 my mother committed suicide. at the age of 37, I have PTSD and severe depression and severe social anxiety. 

for the past 8 years I have been on this site and many others trying to find someone to build a connection with, get close too, make memories with, share things with, eventually build a life together and become a serious couple that settled down.

For the past 8 years I have been told I am ugly, disgusting, worthless, useless, told I have nothing to offer anyone, told I don't deserve love or a relationship or a woman, told I need to kill myself.

For the past 8 years I have been lead on by a couple women who pretended like they wanted me and was interested in me and after 5 or 6 months of this, they would fake their death or call me having sex with someone or disappear then turn around and stalk me.

I have been rejected over 2 thousand times in the past 8 years all because I am obese, I struggle with low thyroid, a very slow metabolism, and genetics from both parents being obese, and just found out that I have very low testosterone, although I have a high sex drive. All of these issues plus my PTSD effects my weight and makes a breeding ground for obesity as my Dr. has put it. I walk 3 miles a day, I eat healthy, baked chicken, boiled veggies, etc. I stay away from soda pops but once a week I will drink a soda, once a month I will eat a pint of ice cream. it helps me stay on track and away from fast food and deep fried stuff. But it doesn't matter, because of my health issues that are causing the obesity.

But see, yet no one wants to get to know that about me, no one wants to get to know anything about me, they just see the outside of me and what income I have then reject me. No one cares for who I am as a person, no one cares for how I am as a person, no one cares what I am like as a person, no one cares about my personality or attitude. No one cares how I would treat them. They just see my weight then walk away.

I may not have much in the looks department to offer, I may not have much in the money department to offer. But what I did have to offer was pure true unconditional love, true loyalty, a heart filled with pure love and a mind filled with acceptance and understanding. someone who wouldn't ever cheated or left, or ever played mind games, someone who would been so loyal to you, someone who would have treated you with gentle care and love. someone who would been very romantic and devoted.

Well, I give up looking, I am done looking. I am to the point I just don't care if I ever find anyone or ever be with anyone. well this is my good bye letter to all the women on here. I hope many of you who I crossed paths with are proud of yourselves for how you did me and how you treated me. and for those of you who I never talked too, sorry we never got a chance. if you would have given me one.

I am just done with it all. I just can't take anymore and am ending it tonight. ",1
"I know tonight is supposed to be a good one but I'm having a hard time shaking the thoughts of just pulling the plug. The thought of going through yet another year in poverty, loneliness, hatred and sadness is almost too much for me to bear.

I'm 23 years old, I've never had a girlfriend, I've barely had any sex to speak of, I work minimum wage shitty jobs, I have no friends, no family to speak of, and no young woman even close to my age seems to want anything to do with me. I get degraded by other men for not having had enough sex, not seeming masculine enough, and while I understand men are supposed to be strong, few people understand that men have feelings too.

It's like my life is some nightmare I can't wake up from. I look young for my age, and while I've been through so much and so many difficult experiences, people only see an 18 year old kid when they look at me. Girls assume I am naive and immature and look the other way, guys assume I'm a pussy. I get nothing, because apparently I am nothing, at least to the naked eye.

"Thereâs something thatâs been on my chest lately, well, itâs been there for a long time, I just didnât know. 

Iâve been depressed. Iâm not diagnosed, Iâm too scared the doctors will tell me what I already know. Im scared that Iâll have to explain to my parents that their happy, always goes-with-the-flow son is depressed. Iâm scared that my dad, whoâs born in raised in the back woods of Texas, will say itâs not a real condition. Iâm scared that my mother will blame herself for not spending more time with me, or that she could have raised me better. Iâm scared that my siblings wonât be comfortable with the fact that their brother is ill. Iâm scared that my friends will abandon me when they realize Iâm not the stable person I pretend to be. Iâm scared that others would find out and wouldnât want to talk to the depressed kid. Iâm scared that my thoughts will get the better of me one of these days. Iâm scared that it wonât get better. 

Iâve just finished my first semester of college. My lack of will and drive has caused my GPA to straddle the line of academic probation which would lead to me eventually getting kicked out of my dream school. Iâve come to realize just how bad my mental state has been for years now. I was able to move away from home and allowed to really look back on my life and in doing that, I realized something. I couldnât remember the last time I was happy, or the last time I woke up in the morning and wanted to get up, or the last time killing myself wasnât on my mind. I never had many friends so Iâve withheld telling them these things when we talk. In fact, no one know about how I really am inside. Sure Iâll sit there, around other people cracking jokes smiling and laughing, but deep down Iâm not the one really there. Thatâs just one of my many mask I use to hide behind. The real me shakes uncontrollably while interacting with other people. I want to scream and run away if Iâm ever around people for too long. I tell my roommates to go out without me because I canât afford it, when really itâs so I can let my feelings out and sob without worrying about them being around. I donât even know why I cry. I just kind of do. I can be sitting in the middle of a conversation and suddenly get this feeling like Iâm getting sucked inside a deep void inside of myself and all I want to do is bawl. But I canât. That would raise questions and those questions would lead to the real me under my hollow shell. And that really scares me. I donât even know who âIâ am anymore. My personality changes with every person I know. I try to avoid it. Iâll binge watch a show on Netflix, Iâll get lost in the story of a game, Iâll connect with these wacky personalities in anime. But lately, Iâve lost interest. Those shows and games donât work like they used to. Now I just stare at a paused screen for hours because Iâve just detached myself from reality. 

Itâs New Years. But Iâm the same me. New and exciting treads are sure to come and go but I will remain the same. Itâs unlikely that Iâll see next year, but maybe Iâll drag through these 365 days just to see what happens. Who knows. 

I donât blame you if you donât read this. Thereâs no structure, and itâs more or less just getting all of my thoughts out that Iâve kept in for so painfully long. But if you did read it, thank you? Honestly I just want this to be buried. I just felt I had to say these things before I lost my mind. Being a full time actor is exhausting lol. 

Sorry for the formatting, Iâm on mobile.

Both my childhood dogs died over the space of 5 months, I only had a few clients as a freelancer and I lost them after falling into depression through it. Since my second dog died, I've lost 14kg (30lbs) - I now weigh just 50kg (110lbs) and I'm really struggling to find the appetite to put some weight back on. I'm 25, single, unemployed, live with my parents (this is at least somewhat normal in my country), and still don't know what I really want to do with my life in terms of a career. This isn't the first time depression has crushed me and set me back with no glimpse of things getting any better. No job prospects, no friends, no money, but I know I'm not alone and there are so many people going through so many similar things right now that are just desperate to get back on track. While every year has slowly gotten worse for me over the last five, I feel like I've earned some perspective from my depression and the mistakes I've made. Depression is a prison. I might be serving a life sentence, but with good behaviour and some rehabilitation, I might be able to leave on parole. I can't think exactly what lead to my acceptance of this sentence but I've never felt this frame of mind before, and now that I do I think I'm ready to start fighting again.

If you've been struggling for years like me, if you want to change, and you know what changes you want to make... I always find myself giving up and looking towards next year as another opportunity to start again, so just do it for yourself because you realise you need to and not because it's a new year and that's what people do. None of them last because they all watch their friends and colleagues fall off the wagon together. It doesn't work. Remember these people don't care about change the way we do. We can't treat this change as callously as they do. Ordinary people want to improve too, sure, but we *need* to improve.

Do it for yourself. Happy (or not) New Year.",2
"Iâve mentioned it a couple times on here lately, but my depression has been ruining most parts of my life, including job performance. Iâve got a meeting in the morning with my bosses about my poor performance and I think Iâll be fired.  
  
Does anyone have any similar experiences? How did you handle it? How would you begin to explain to your boss the toll depression takes on you and your performance. My meeting is at 8am tomorrow morning and Iâm desperate to talk to people with similar experiences. Thank you so much.  
  
**Update:** Thank you everyone for your support, kind words, and sharing your own experiences. I had the meeting today. I have to admit I broke down a bit, had trouble getting sentences out, but I tried my best to explain how depression was affecting me and my job performance. They were very kind and understanding, but still said I need to either resign or they will have to start the termination process.  
  
Long story short: Itâs over, I failed again. ",2
"This time last year, I was talking to my soon-to-be girlfriend, excited for the new year. Now I'm alone, suicidal and worse than last year. Shit doesn't change. New years resolutions don't mean shit when no matter what you do, no matter how hard you try, you'll still be fucked over by everyone you trust. I hope I find the courage to kill myself this year.",3
"This time of year when I most crave for social interactions, friends, even family and none of them responded. Everybodyâs busy living their lives while unemployed, depressed me canât stop thinking of dying. I messaged about a dozen of people today and none of them replied.
Mustâve felt good having a life and actually be busy.
Just the first day of 2018 and Iâm already crying.
",2
"Iâm hoping thereâs an active forum somewhere online I can chat with others at. Talking to someone 1 on 1 on reddit has always bothered me, so I appreciate anyone who offers but Iâm definitely looking more for a casual group setting so I donât feel like Iâm the center of attention. I may feel like I want to die but Iâm definitely not going to do it tonight, others could use the help.",3
Everyone else was out with their friends or could enjoy the company of their family. I played the sims had a few drinks and smoked weed and went to sleep at 11. I don't want this year to be like the next...,3
"All these fucking people celebrating for no reason, setting off fireworks, and disturbing my life and depression.  I hate other people.  I am an outcast from society and everything about it pisses me off",1
"Jan. 17, 2017 I told myself I was sick of going through every year wanting to die, wishing for death, and that if things hadn't changed I wouldn't see the start of 2018. For the first time in over a decade I had a couple months where I didn't want to kill myself, and that fell apart as quickly as it started. I'm worse off than I've been in a long time, and attempted suicide 4 times in the past 3 months, ending up with two hospitalizations and being committed to behavioral center. The only thing that kept me from attempting tonight is a fear of failure, ending up back in a hospital, and the fact that I now live with my parents again. I guess the fact that at some point last year I didn't want to die made me hesitant to follow through with my promise, but honestly I hate that I didn't. It's just another thing that I couldn't hold myself to. I don't really know why I'm writing this, I wanted to tell someone but I don't have anyone to tell that will actually listen at this point. Happy New Year friends ",3
"I feel a bit better with the drugs out of my system. I spent new year's morning on the beach till sunrise. As the sun approached, rays of orange and blue leapt between low level nimbostratus clouds painting a silky leopard-shaped canvas. Light etched it's way through the aesthetic sky-scape soon finding it's shortest path to the breakers below. I wondered if the love in my chest surfaced by this natural beauty was reciprocal in your heart somewhere.. though on second thoughts I guessed resentment  might occupy most of our space there facilitated by my loathing and misery. Take it as obsession, ill-health, whatever, I can't walk around on a broken leg with a smile on my face. I went in boots and all, young and blind as they come.. 

Here's a thought:
Perhaps staring at your weaknesses in crippling shame and regret is more likely to preserve the good in you than perpetuate failure over and over again, if you manage to recover in time.. That's a relieving thought I guess.. 

I remember when we fell in love.. I was so stupid. More words.. Just words... There's no one else.. Not that it matters.. Back to exciting sentences followed by exclamation marks and smiley faces..",1
"I am finally numb to it. And it feels good. It feels good to feel nothing instead of crying and just wishing to be dead, the mental agony Iâve experienced throughout my life is so very painful in a way I canât describe. Me sitting down calmly and wanting to die is a lot better than me crying and hurting myself because the âpainâ is so terrible. 

I canât escape him. I canât escape my father. His voice is in my head every time I donât do anything perfectly. When I look in the mirror. What he said about me mirrors how I think about myself still. 
I always end up dating men just like him. They make me feel crazy and emotionally and mentally abuse me to no end. The guy I thought I loved just told me yesterday that I should be happy that it took him âthis longâ to start pretending to throw heavy objects at me angrily.

The numbness is much better than the depression. Maybe Iâll get numb to the point where itâll be easy to kill myself instead of always chickening out. Thereâs nothing for me here. I am selfish and want just one thing: Love, and I canât get it. And Iâm not going to stay around waiting in pain and mental anguish until I die, just so other people can benefit off of my love and care. I want something for me for once.

I feel so alone and I think about dying almost every day. I wish I didnât. I feel like the sooner I end my life the better. But I canât bring myself to do it just yet. A tiny bit of me thinks that maybe I should wait, maybe I will get Lucky. But will the suffering be worth it. 

Maybe someone will find me with my wrists slit. Maybe someone will find me hung up in my closet. Maybe then people will understand. Because right now no one does. No one ever has. No matter how many attempts Iâve made to get people to notice Iâm hurting. I fantasize about my death sometimes. I know thatâs not normal. Hence one more reason why I should not be alive. ",1
"Attention: I didnât expect this to be so long, but I guess I had to let myself go and just write how Iâm feeling, Iâm sorry if Iâm wasting your time... Itâs a mess, I know, (the paragraph organization) but anyways, enjoy what I wrote about how I feel, I guess...

Hi, again here, yeah... M18. So, yeah, I think Iâm going crazy... I ran out of my medicine about 5 days ago or so... Iâve been on it for a month. Felt really out of myself honestly... Wasnât sad, but I wasnât happy either. Something like a zombie? Did some research... Depersonalization... 

Oh well, I stopped taking it not because I wanted to, but because my psychiatrist doesnât give refills unless you go and see him personally so he can see you, understandable, except the fact that I have to pay $40 for each appointment? Plus the medicine... Yeah... I donât know about that... 

Anyways, Iâve been feeling weird... I donât know. Iâve been competitive all my life, and nothing has been working for me these past days. Used to play video games, Iâm pretty good at them, now I suck, and I do play regularly, I just canât play well. I like to do BMX... Iâm having troubles doing tricks I normally do... Iâm getting very frustrated and I honestly think of jumping out of my balcony... But, sadly, I canât kill myself... So, again, I donât know! Oh man...

 Iâve been smoking cannabis these past months, tried it once and, well, I donât really have friends, I mean, I consider them as friends but when your friends has depression, has been in a 72-hour watch, and other bunch of stuff, you should be worried right? Not them... Sad, sad, sad... (For me). But yeah, again, I donât think the cannabis is making me go crazy just because I smoke only before going to sleep and I just take about 5 hits from a one-hitter I have, which I would say is about, maybe like, 0.2g each time I hit it? Maybe even less actually, but yeah, thatâs the amount.

Oh man, this is getting really long, looks like a story haha... But yeah, Iâm bored, nothing seems to be fun anymore, I donât feel like doing anything, but I feel like Iâm wasting my time, which feels bad... 

Thatâs how I feel, I think... So, I donât know... I guess Iâll have to pay $40 to my psychiatrist to get my medicine again so I donât get suicidal thoughts again and I actually kill myself... Hope everyoneâs having a good day I guess?

Thanks for reading...",3
"I'm just some dumb fucking tranny so my death wouldn't mean shit but another statistic. I relapsed for the first time fucking forever. My meds are fucked I'm a month out from seeing my doctor to get them fixed I see my therapist soon but he can't prescribe shit. My mom tells me she loves me but I can't talk to her cause I'll dissapoint her. It'd break her heart to say ""I want to fucking die and splice my arms open"". I'm not going to cause more issues for anyone else. I can't start hormones even with my moms support because we have to do it so secretly and if I wait until I'm legally an adult waiting that long for hormones I don't want to be seen as some tranny fag dude I want to pass I never want to have to hear me be referred to female again I want to live as my authentic self it's horrible not being able to live as who I fucking am and have to live as a subset I just want to be normal I wish my brain was normal I wish I had friends I don't even have anyone to fucking talk to except to nobody on a forum I'm just so Fucking pathetic. Fuck ",3
Someone gas me up and tell me i can do this because im about to scream and give the fuck up. Doing school work increases my appeal for suicide but i really am trying to push through this,2
"Iâve sat in a dark room for 5 hours staring at a wall, doing nothing. Yet I still felt as bored as if I were to just watch Netflix or play games. I feel bored and scared. Scared that I lost my mind and will never be normal again.",2
"i build up shells to stop people from seeing who i am. i may seem happy but thats just an act, if people saw who i really am theyd put me away in some hospital. I sit here blood on my legs out of the cuts that i madea My shell is breaking I cant do anythind nobody can knwo idon tknow what to do anyt more",3
I tried to kill myself multiple times since 2015 And I haven't been successful. Oh well... Another year to suffer through this hell ,3
"I have been trying for a long time. I dont know if I can ever get over the things that have happened to me in my life or if I can ever be happy. I have a daughter so I dont want to do anything that will make it harder for her. But I dont know what else to do. I dont know if Im codependent on this misery or what. I know every day I wake up its going to be more of the same. I hate feeling this way. I want to be happy and alive and 'me' again. But so much has happened and Im going to be 43 this month. Why should I keep trying to find solutions? By the time I fix what needs fixing...even if I can, Ill be to old to enjoy any of it. Im tired of living a life of pain and suffering. I mask it with smoking weed or meds. It seems like I just lose more as I go on. Friends pass away from disease or suicide, family members pass on. I am struggling with wether or not to end my life. I wonder if I should look for easy ways to do it. I keep thinking about it but the ways I envision all seem like horrible ways to go out and Ive been through enough pain. Why should I try to hang on again? I wish that I mattered. Or that I was important enough for someone to care. After 20 years of ptsd and the anxiety and depression Im in a place where Im unable to work or provide for myself. I dont know if I do or dont want disability or if I can even get it. I grew up cutting down trees, building houses and raising horses and what not. My pride is something that comes up over and over. Ive been out of work for over 5 years. Ive been kept isolated for most of that and its one thing to have therapy and medicine. But Im still stuck here dependent on someone who has abused me. But maybe I should give them more time. I know Im not perfect. I have my own issues. Maybe Im just screwing everything up with this line of thinking. But I do know that I am co dependent. After all the abuse and nightmares and the pain, I dont know if I will ever be able to live the life I want to. Why would I choose to stay like this? I dont want to keep going like this. This isnt how its supposed to be. Life and the world around us really does fascinate me and I always wanted to find a place in it. But after all this time of being cut off from it I cant keep coming up with reasons to just keep hurting. I dont want to have to keep coming back and doing things like this as a last ditch effort.  I used to be so resilient and able to bounce back, nowadays im just so worn out and tired and drained.  Life keeps dangling a carrot in front of my face.  And like a fool I try to chase it, just to to find more pain.  Im tired of trying.  Im tired of feeling like Im damned.  I dont want to get on here and make a post like this for attention.  I just DONT want to feel like this anymore.  And its getting worse and harder to deal with.  If there was a button I could push that would end it painlessly I wonder if i would press it.  When its like this I wonder why in the hell I wouldnt press it.  There were things I wanted to do with my life.  Things I was sure that I was here to do.  And now it seems my whole lifes purpose was just to suffer.  I still feel like that little boy who was beaten bloody as a kid and taught to live in fear.  Why is it that he cant get justice?  Life was suppose to be somuch fuller and more beautiful.  But for me, my mind is under attack more often than not.  I have been doing all I can for years now, Id be lying if I said some things havent gotten better.  But at this rate Ill never get there in time.  And Ive been doing it on my own with little to no help while other people are working against me.  When will it get better?  When do the good things start happening?  When can I rest?",1
"How often is it that a suicidal person actually goes through with it eventually? Like if someone was suicidal years ago but had some help and got a little better, how often is it that hey'd have a sort of relapse?  
Sorry, I'm feeling super hopeless right now and I don't know if I want good news or bad news (to be honest I'm not really sure which is which either)",3
"This is on wikipedia, the page title is ""Social psychology"".

&gt;  The self-serving bias is the tendency to attribute dispositional causes for successes, and situational causes for failure, particularly when self-esteem is threatened. This leads to assuming one's successes are from innate traits, and one's failures are due to situations, including other people.[18]:109 Other ways people protect their self-esteem are by believing in a just world, blaming victims for their suffering, and making defensive attributions, which explain our behavior in ways which defend us from feelings of vulnerability and mortality.[18]:111 Researchers have found that mildly depressed individuals often lack this bias and actually have more realistic perceptions of reality (as measured by the opinions of others).[20]

Lol, sorry, i should have explained what this shit means.

Realistic perception means you can understand both personal deffects and also situation ones, it just means you don't excuse yourself for your mistakes or wrong doings, but you also will not excuse anyone. You have higher moral standards. You see things for what they are. 

Happy people will fuck up today, rationalize their bullshit away in one sentence and completely forget about it. They say it's strenght but in reality is just ignoring.

"Hello..

I've been in a bad way for over 5 years as of today and tried almost every anti depressant but none of them help. I see a therapist and that helps a little having someone to talk to.. but doesn't really fix anything. 

I really try to be happy I exercise I got a job I was good at 

Well recently I got fired for ""Not being a good fit anymore"" or ""You seem really down and its bad in the work place"" 

I've turned to cocaine witch atleast makes me feel happy for 30 minutes before I feel like shit again 

I'm not a heavy user but it honestly seems like drugs are the only thing that really help and I know that sounds crazy.. 

My family has given up on my bullshit and I dont blame them I get really sad and upset over nothing and without a job I have just become a burden. 

I have tried to kill myself 2 times and I really reallly don't want to get to that point again but I just really need advice on what to do. 

I have stopped taking drugs for just over 3 months now to see if that was making it worse but it wasnt 

Anyone out there? ",3
"Hey. If youâre reading this then...well that means I went through with what I was thinking. Then again, it was a stupid idea so if you are reading this Iâve gone insane. Now, you will not know my name because it doesnât need to be revealed for this. Maybe someday Iâll be strong enough to face it, I mean people will find out eventually. Youâre probably really confused...so Iâll just get straight to the point. Iâm here to tell you my story. Usually I donât talk about my life...actually I really donât talk about it at all. There are certain things Iâm not going to share of course, things I vowed to myself I would keep secret until death. Honestly I donât even know why Iâm doing this. I just really need to get some stuff of my chest. Life. Sucks. At least it does for me. It didnât always..I used to be this innocent bright and cheery kid..but I guess the more I grew the more I realized how messed up society and basically the entire world is. You see, the first time I ever felt different was in 5th grade. People would make fun of me, call me stupid, tease me, call my old life weird and dumb. There were other things but I can't remember...Iâve spent 3 years learning to forget. The day it became too much for me to hold in is when everything changed. I was sitting down taking it all in when I just broke. My shield that was keeping them from hurting me...shattered into a million pieces along with my heart, my mind, my soul, my life. I ran to the bathroom and cried for what seemed like forever. I went back to class acting as if I was fine and that nothing happened. Everyday it just got worse. Then summer came, and I was able to start feeling normal. No more people to worry about, I didn't dread leaving my house. 6th grade came around, and I met the most amazing people that I will remember for the rest of my life. 6th grade was a good year, my grades were good, I had great friends...but there was still something that was off. Around the end of the year I started getting these awful thoughts. Regret filled my life. There were so many things that I wished I could redo and I still do. Everyday of my life I think about it and think of how stupid I was. Iwas so careless and didnât realize that what I had done could ruin my life. Now what I did exactly wonât be shared...if anyone ever found out I wouldnât be able to live with myself. I can barely do that now and Iâm the only one who knows. Summer came around again, and the thoughts got worse. They aren't just bad thoughts about being sad and depressed...I started getting suicidal thoughts...hundreds of them everyday. I dreaded going back to school. I had people in my class that bullied me in 5th grade. I didnât want to go through that again. So...one night I had an idea. I was at a very low point and was contemplating suicide. I ended up chickening out...but some days I wonder if it would have actually worked. Part of me wishes I went through with it, the other half is glad I didnât. School came around, I was performing well, and the kids didnât even say anything at all. My friends and I became even more close.My teachers were amazing. 7th grade, I have to say was the happiest point of my life I had ever been in for an extreme amount of time. When it came to an end however so did that happiness. Suicide crossed my mind even more, I started self harming in ways that no one would notice. I would do the stereotypical thing and just blame the cat. 8th grade came. My grades dropped. I couldnât find the energy to do anything. I was constantly tired and I still am. My dreams faded, my hopes for a better life went away because I know that would never happen. I got this app, kik. I should've known to delete the minute I got it. Part of my past revolves around this dumb app. Actually itâs what started EVERYTHING. And itâs all. my. fault. I hate myself for it. I worry about so many people Iâve met on the app. I love them all, they're great people and Iâve stopped caring for myself ever since then. I just wish everything would go away. There is honestly so much more to this story, but if I were to tell it all it would take me a million years. Now...weâve hit the present. Iâve stopped eating three meals a day. Some Days I barely get it one. But thatâs ok...I like the feeling of hunger. I like the pain of the blade when it passesover my arm. I like being alone, the less people who know me, the less I can hurt them. The more fake smiles I put on, the more people leave me alone, and believe Iâm fine. Iâm suicidal but no one knows. I canât tell anyone...I wonât tell anyone.At least personally. This, what Iâm doing anonymously is fine. I can tell my story without feeling too judged. Even if I was...it would be nothing compared to how I judge and hate myself. And now youâve made it to the end...sorry it was so long. Thereâs so much more to it than that...that's just the basic stuff behind my real emotions...the emotions that are fading. The emotions that I will soon lose, in fact Iâm pretty sure I already have. ",1
"My depression is catching up to me... again... right when I think I'm doing alright, the drowning begins again. I'm tired of running around in circles to get away from my demons only to end up consumed by them anyway.... 

My life has been constant ups and downs, from abusive parents and partners, to self sabotage and circumstances out of my control that almost ruined my life...

"I'm here to share my feelings. What does it mean when you get a sudden pang of sadness that refuses to leave n leaves you wanting to cry for now reason?  I've googled it and it's given me three reasons 
1. Hormonal imbalance. 
2. Anemia.
3. Depression. 

Let me tell you a bit about myself. 
I'm Li, female, 20 years old. I've had my fair share of ups and downs in life. I was in a bad relationship for almost a year before I found the person I actually wanted to be with. But the situation in which I got into a relationship with him was rough you could say.  You see he was my best friend and I didn't want to loose him. He'd liked me for almost 2 years at that time and I knew I'd loose him forever if I kept him waiting.  But know I'm very happy I did because it's the best thing that ever happened to me.

The person before him, was the worst choice of my life, but not the first worst choice.  I've made two wrong choices in life that I regret. 

1. My ex. Initially all was fine and I liked the time we shared together. My feelings started to get strong until I was stuck in a place where I thought I couldn't be able to live without him. But sadly his feelings were the total opposite. As time went by he started losing interest. He did cheat on me, three times. I was stupid to keep on giving chances to him. He knew I was all his and maybe that's why he started taking me for granted. And that's when things got bad. I know I'm not a good person and I've done some things too but I'm sure I was all loyal.
He started getting abusive. 

Valentine's Day '14. I was 16. We lived 6 bus stops away and it took time to get to him. Traffic made it take even longer . When I got there he was pissed because I took so much time. He grabbed me by the arm and started calling me names i'd gotten used to at that point. We walked until we reached darker and empty streets. We didn't talk to each other. We held hands. His grip was tight, squeezing my fingers together. We reached a house that looked like it was empty. All the lights were out. It wasn't his house, just a random house. We went in through the gate and to the side of the house so that it hid us from the main road and from any neighbouring house. Basically we were hidden from the world.  He started kissing me hard. His hands were on my shoulders. I was pinned to the wall. I tried to move but he was heavier than me, even though he was as skinny as a stick. I was uncomfortable. I didn't kiss him back. He got pissed, called me a slut, said I was cheating on him. The usual. Then it came. The first slap. It was hard and sudden and unexpected. I didn't know what was happening. I was crying at that point. My mouth was shut with his hand. His other hand moved down. Kissing me on my neck Now, biting and sucking . I'd had enough I wanted to go home. I told him to stop. I'd had enough, I kept telling him to stop. He didn't. But I didn't stop.  He got irritated I guess or IDK. Came more slaps. And a final push to the wall. And he walked away.. 
I didn't know my way back home, my way to the bus stop that would take me home. I was alone. My heart was crying. I found my way back, went home. Texted him again and again apologizing. I thought he hated me I thought he'd break up. I couldn't bear that idea. I was in a bad place.

"     You know when that feeling of disappointment when you discover that santa wasn't real and it was just your parents all along? I can't help but feel like that has been my whole life up until now.

     My life seemed just perfect until middle school. I was an optimistic social butterfly with a family that had a decent paycheck. At that time, it seemed like everything was placed perfectly and my life was the envy of others.

      When I made it to middle school, everyone would point out how ""black"" i was (My family is all white, and i happen to be slightly darker than all of them with some really coarse hair). I would tell my mother about how upset it made me, and she would reassure me that I had nothing to worry about. She said that I was slightly darker because she drank lot's of pepsi when she was pregnant (this doesn't sound rediculous when you're 13). By this point everyone at my school thinks I've gone mad or that I'm truly in denial about my skin. I wasn't, I was telling them genuinely what I thought was true. 

     When i turned 14, my parents got into a pretty hairy argument that was pretty normal at the time. My mom would be upset that my dad caught one of her lies, and she would make herself seem like the victim. My dad was pissed that she could easily make everyone feel so sorry for her (even if she was in the wrong), and he looked me straight in the eye and told me ""I'm not your real father"". I never cry... ever. But when the man tgat raised you you're entire life can just flick you off his shoulder like that. That... shit... destroyed... me.

     Turns out, my mother cheated on father she was dating my father for 5 years, and she accidentally conceived me. She tried to keep it a secret from the family and even my father.... and idk how, but she managed to keep everyone fooled. According to my cousins, aunts, and uncles, everyone already knew. She told the ENTIRE family to keep the truth from me.

    While i was in school, I couldn't look anyone in the eye. Not because i was mixed, but because I spent 2 years trying to convince everyone i was white. After this whole situation, there were two different kinds of people at my school. People that could capitalize on my misery, and the people that would sympathize me. Both of these kind of people disgust me.

     I'm 22 now and i moved out of my mothers home and now I really feel hopeless. I don't have a lot of friends, I don't feel as if I can trust anyone really. I hate the feeling of being manipulated, but i also hate the feeling of being alone. I'm beyond confused and idk how to fix myself.

TL:DR - My mother cheated on my father and I'm a result of it. I wasn't told that my father wasn't my biological father until i was 14 and it's a curse that wont go away",1
"A little rant.

This year has been the same as far as I can remember, feeling sad, angry, sick, but overall, tired. No valid reason for that. 

Failing at college because the lack of motivation/anxiety, but mainly because I can't force myself to do anything more than be there.

Love life... Well, don't even want to talk about that, I just suck at this, don't even need to be ugly when you are just... Not an interesting person who also tends to be clingy.

Another year goes by and the rock goes downhill once more.",2
"I hate taking my pills, I feel so numb and dizzy. And whenever the pill wear off I just get so depressed because of the thoughts that I have to take pills to be happy.

"26, the only son of a proud Asian family, gay since birth. Coming out is never an option at it would DESTROY my parents, and I love them so bad. 
The main problem, I'm struggling with overcoming this ""love"" with my straight friend (For almost 3 years now, he just got married last year). As I learnt how to fake my feeling since I was a kid, I did it so well even now he still has no idea about (At least it's what I think). In the last two years I've been trying to keep the distance but still no use, the feeling just keeps getting stronger.  Ironically enough, all my life I've met so many people, but only have feeling for that only guy. Yep, the first ever, and only one til this day. Like a fucking joke, sounds romantic (if we remove the gender details) but so fucked up at the same time (as it actually is). Even worse, he sure loves me (like bro to bro). I did so many mean stuffs to keep the distance, things like replying K, being aggressive, ignoring his birthday, his new year message etc. very very mean, but the guy seems to be too patient with me, looks like he clearly wants us back to be best bro as we did before. Forgot to mention, we were co-worker for more than a year, then life happens, he moved abroad (This was when I decided to stop being nice to him - with hope of finding an escape for myself but failed :/), and later on, got married. That means there's been a real geographical distance between us as well - even that wouldn't do any good to my feeling.
It's such a shame to admit this but you guys can't imagine how many night I've lost sleep, crying all the tears I got, praying that god or any higher power up there, please erase me from this life, then the next day everyone would forget my existence and just move on. I want to die, but don't want to kill my parents selfishly. I'm tired of being alone, but then I can only fake my feeling to an extent, showing affection to a girl - that's too much for me. Would also do me no good for sure, I'm hungry for true happiness, something that can't be faked.
I still go to work everyday, fake my laughter. I have a job that pays well, you can say I'm financial independent. But none of this matters soon, being the only son I MUST keep the family's bloodline going. But well, with this mess inside my head, I don't know what to do now. I've been thinking about confessing it all to him, maybe that will actually freak him out and I can finally move on? But, damn, so many but, the idea of actually losing him from my life forever scares the shit out of me. After all I'm this loser who can have his whole week brightened just by receiving a text ""hey"" from a bro I'm secretly in love, even though I'll just pretend to ignore it or reply with K. It's that pathetic.",1
"After having gained some optimism back and starting to be a bit more positive, here it comes again an ocean of sadness that waves over me. Thoughts circulating around my brain at what seems to be at light-speed.

It's crazy how you can think and feel this is by far the lowest point of my life, it can't get any lower, and then a lower point comes along sooner or later that makes you reflect ""wow how can this be lower then that time? ""How much lower can the human mind and heart tolerate before it caves in?"" 

I'm on my 4th. Honestly i'm actually impressed i'm still here somehow.

Of all my 30 years of living this is has been the most educational and informative year of life ever, the year that taught me all the truths of life and humanity.

Are humans completely selfish by design? Or is this a product of centuries of brainwash by society? Humans by nature are selfish and competitive but it's more of a survivor defense mechanism than anything, I think all the rest of the cruel values and selfishness that has been brainwashed into humanities minds and hearts is definitely a product of the masses. I especially know this since I use to be one of them, utterly brainwashed, hurting others never realizing it or the extent. But thankfully I always in the depths of my heart had that urge, that desire to be a better human being programmed into my heart even in the bigoted ways of my past.

Everybody lies, EVERYONE LIES. When I say that I don't mean 100% I mean 80% the majority who far outweigh the few people you can run into who are apart of that other 20%, meaning it's almost invisible. Even that neighbor with his kids, loving wife, who wakes at 5am everyday to drink his coffee and goes to work, who smiles at you when he sees you in the morning and asks ""how you are?"" and bids a ""good day"" to you is some selfish prick who believes, who teaches and preaches these terrible values to his family thinking it's normal, it's alright, ""we're the good ones"", ""we should be proud for being such upstanding citizens"" even that guy is a total selfish evil prick that goes blind to most of societies eyes.

I don't know how to live with myself anymore, I've tried for months to figure out a way to want to continue to live in what I know and feel.

How can I integrate back into society knowing how they treats others? The racial inequality, how they view homosexuality, bisexuality, how they treat and think about people who are transgender, classicism, sexism, nationalism, religious discrimination, linguistic discrimination, neurological descrimination. How most women treat most men now, they're all evil. How transgender people treat cisgender people because ""they could never understand"" whelp they treated us this way so now ""stfu"" your cis you have no say you ""evil cis!"" It's nothing but hate one way or the other, even the person fighting for what's right is doing it by doing something so wrong, even if the person is good in your eyes there's something dark and fucked up about them.

I'm no saint but everyday I self-reflect, everyday I look at how I can improve as a human, I can do wrong and I can hurt, but I have the self-awareness to listen to my fellow human and learn from it and be better, to see my faults, where I can improve, because I can't stand the thought of a stranger hurting because I had something to do with it directly or indirectly.

Let's pollute, let's kill our planet, let's have plastic surgery for non-medical reasons, let's hurt animals, let's make MORE AND MORE AND MORE MONEY, let's bully in real life and on the internet, let's have privilege, let's eye for an eye, because if we suffered in the past I guess than those who oppressed should suffer now, even the innocent ones, so you're fucked if you're a man, or you're white, or you're Christian, or Jewish, or cisgender, or bisexual, or or or or or or. Let's not be educated, let's think we learned so much and enough, we shouldn't have to be taught better anymore, because ""we know better"".

Why is there so much risk to living a new day everyday even if you're mildly successful?

If I'm bisexual, my sexuality will probably get dismissed left and right all day.

If i'm gay I better not be somewhere like Lithuania.

If i'm transgender, well i'll have to look over my shoulder and fear for my life 68% of the time while never being taken seriously as my gender.

If i'm cisgender, well you better get use to the fact you're ""evil"" because I guess I had a conventional upbringing.

If i'm religious, well that's all hocus pocus now, you're beliefs are secondary to mines!

If you're unattractive, best get use to the idea you'll never get taken completely seriously, you'll have to work and prove yourself 20 times more to other people and probably still not get as good as a opportunity.

If you're a woman, hope you love that unequal salary and being slut-shammed for wearing a skirt or shorts one size too small and tight.

If you're shorter than 5'7, good luck in the dating world, HA good luck getting that job because statistically taller people are hired more and valued more.

If you have tattoos, get ready for those stereotypes and awkward looks of judgement.

If you're ""fat"", GUESS WHAT YOU'RE LAZY.

If you're too skinny, remember women love fits guys and men love voluptuous ladies!

If you're not making at least 100K, might as well die, you're like that crap that went on clearance at a dollar store nobody wants and will go salvage.

If you're bi-polar, have ptsd, depressed, on the spectrum and many of the other frequent and normal neurological conditions everyone suffers normally daily in society, all those immensely gorgeous models, those intellectually genius people, all those successful and wealthy people who have those conditions, no one bats an eye to them, because if you have an issue and your worth doesn't translate to instant money, well you're just a fucked up person, a waste. 

Doesn't matter if you came from a violent background, homelessness, starvation, pain, a violent family, a history of prejudice. The older you are the more you better have your shit together! Because money, looks, degrees, that shit is just handed to you like bubblegum from a candy dispenser apparently.

Fuck you for telling me it'll get better, you mean if I somehow manage another week, or year, or 2 or 3 without fucking completely losing it mentally and going insane or offing myself because that's how psychological distress works, it gets the best of you.

It'll get better alright, when a gosh damn existential miracle happens that magically makes most people not shit even when they're ""good people"" who ""mean well"", when i'm not oppressed every damn waking second because I had no freaking say in my birth!

EAT IT BITCH SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST. Thank you humanity you have passed a beautiful legacy to our society. The hippies of back then had it all right, peace and love all ya'll. But those hippies were just a bunch of potheaded wastebags and their little mantra didn't translate to selfishness and money.

Thank you so much.",1
My âfriendsâ never talk to me unless Iâm the only one available and Iâm so sick of it but I donât want to burn those bridges cause I know itâll hurt more to get rid of them altogether than to just suck up the pain of being left out ,1

"**PLEASE READ CAREFULLY**

I am so confused guys. So, basically my story  began 5 months ago, It was triggered by reading the news about Chester's bennington suicide. I am 20 years old male, with a previous history of OCD(Fear of getting a heroin addict.), but I can't tell if it is the same or worse. It is horrific. Here is what happens. After I read the news, in my head went something like 'If he can do it, then why shouldn't I?' And I started having intrusive suicidal thoughts, I will give an example:

-A friend: Lets go and drink a coffe tomorrow.

-Me: Okay

-My mind: If I don't suicide by then.

So basically at the begining (the first few hours) It was terrifying, but I was unaware what is going to happen after this.

So I got pretty paniced and googled: 'intrusive suicidal thoughts' and major depessive disorder or OCD showed up. I entered both web pages and both said '10 times higher chance of commiting suicide.'

This was the moment when everything fell appart.

This was the moment when I felt this rapid change in my mind.

This was the moment in which I felt like a part of me changed into something horrific.(Okay this was too much movie like sentence, but anyway.)

So basically my life is pretty rough since then I will try to be as accurate as possible, I have days in which I feel relatively normal. So, here are the things happening in my head and body. Some of them are constant, some of them are not.

Intrusive suicidal thoughts which feel real. I really hope they are intrusive, and not true Suicide Ideation. With a confusion If I want them or not. Which is terrifying.

Knot in the stomach.

Whenever I look online for something to buy, there is a feeling like 'There is no point I won't be here soon' and a knot in the stomach.

Feeling like I can't do anything fun, like can't relax I don't know how to describe it.

Less interest in people.

Less apetite.

Sudden feeling of tiredness sometimes.

Nearly constant, uneasiness.

Scary feeling, when I imagine my life without these thoughts, it feels like kind of boring?! I don't know it this is the right word.

Feeling on the edge, feeling like my life is shortened, like I will do something bad soon.

Random feeling of life being pointless without a reason with a variating duration.

Random TERRIFYING Intese feeling like trapped in life.

Random feeling that I need to escape, but there is no place to.

When I am feeling bad, there are constant thoughts, random things I have read on google reddit, with a pictures of the article I was reading.

I stopped working, and now I feel like If I work or feel overwhelmed I will do it.

I stopped University becausw of it, and because I didn't find it interesting.(I made a mistake with chosing my subject.

Intrusive unsettling feeling real scenarious in which my best friend tell me If I want to work with him.(We had a pretty sucessful store.

Feeling like I don't want to admit that I am suicidal?!

Feeling like I don't want to get better?!? I tried finding a reason, but I can't think a reason why, like I stop thinking when I try.

Fear that I developed these thoughts, a few days before Chester's thing, and I try to see my chats to see if there are some signs, but it is impossible to be sure.(This is not a big deal, but I am trying to be as accurate as possible.)

At first I thought this is depression, however I don't show many signs of depression. Then I thought it is Anxiety, but It feels darker and realer than Anxiety.

Weird negative feeling when babies arround.

Random feeling like everything I see is too much?

Fear/Feeling like this is something unknown, incurable and it is impossible to feel like before.

**Now on new year everyone is wishing ""many years"" and it triggers anxiety everytime like i don't want it?!? Guys I am really sad over this what the fuck.**

Intense moments when I feel like I am losing control. (I will give you an example of what it looks and feels like.) It happened 2-3 times for the last 5 months.

And the most important and horrific:Â  Scary intense moment with like a physical urge ######6. As it follows: It is triggered randomly. This is what happens: life feels meaningless with a weird image stuck in the back of my head feeling, like future idk, feeling of unrasiness, unsettled feeling, negative scenarious, I try to calm myself with a positive thoughts, I succeed for like a second, then it feels like the negative thoughts, reinforce themselfs and become more and more intense, then I am like 'If i feel like i will do something i will go to the hospital, chill., then like 'it doesn't matter you feel trapped' and it becomes even more intense and more intense uneasiness feeling, i close my eyes laying in my bed, almost starting to feel normal for a couple of seconds, then i open my eyes and everything in my head is intense again, i try again to counter them, it becomes even more intense.

I have several questions:

What does it look like?

Does it look like actual suicide ideation/suicidality?

Do I sound suicidal? I am so confused

Thanks in advance.

After multiple admissions to hospital and trying heaps of different medication my doctor has recommended I try TMS. I was wondering if anyone here had any experience with it and if they could tell me what to expect. I'm a bit sceptical but I'm willing to give it a go.,3
"I know this sort of post isnât original or whatever but here it is. 

Itâs New Years Eve today where I am and honestly... I donât think I could care any less. 

Iâm so tired of pretending to give a shit about everything. About people about things about university and assignments. Mostly Iâm tired of other people pretending to give a shit about me because they donât. Thatâs it. They donât. 

My family say they care yet constantly bombard me with all of their problems expecting me to have a magical solution. My friends are going through their own shit and whilst they try thereâs nothing they can do for me. My girlfriend well... thatâs something else entirely. I know sheâs not happy. I know sheâd rather not be with me. Sheâs been down this road before got the T shirt she shouldnât have to deal with my bs too. I love her so much I donât want to put her through this. 

But the issue is I canât ever see myself getting better. It feels impossible. All I want to do everyday is stay in bed. I want to sleep all of the time. Half the time Iâm not even physically tired I just... everything is too much effort. I canât win. I really canât. Iâve been trying for years but it never gets better. Not for people like me. Weâre destined to suffer and bleed and cry forever. What sort of life is that?

I donât think I want to see the New Year. I just want to end it all. ",2
"Been having some weird stuff happen to my personality/mood and I think that it might be depression. The only thing is that I donât really feel sad? Here is a post I made earlier describing what is happening to /r/askdocs


I have noticed or been told things about myself recently that I donât feel are consistent with me in the past. My feelings are dulled, I talk in somewhat of a monotone (people tell me, I canât hear it), and sometimes I donât make any facial expressions so people think that I donât like them when I really do. Often I will be in a social environment and people will say my name to pull me out of a kind of thoughtless trance where I stare off into the distance with a blank mind, I never remember it starting, just being pulled out of it by someone else. I sometimes get asked if I am high when I am stone cold sober.

I have also been having some weird thoughts, like to jump off of a balcony to my death, or violent ones like to stab someone with a knife I am holding or to crash my car on purpose. (I donât want to do either of these things, I will just get a thought like âdo it, stab them in the neckâ or something) I would like to emphasize that I am not suicidal or even unhappy at all. Sometimes I look in the mirror and something looks off about me that I canât put my finger on, I look like someone else. Also different people often ask me âare you ok?â This bugs me because I am always ok, do I have a weird look on my face or something? I never hear them ask other people that, what is wrong with me, it makes me think that I am mentally challenged or something and everyone has been told except for me. There might be more stuff but I canât remember.

All of this stuff has happened in the past year, maybe because of stress? I am a 19 year old male, moved away to college this year so big life change but these things were happening before then also. Help/suggestions much appreciated.


TLDR: I think something is changed with me

"Ive recently had the alpha stim bought for me by a parent. Its a device which clips electrical nodes to your head, stimulating the brain to activate parts of it which may be inactive or overactive due to depression. Been using it a couple of months now and have improved greatly. I can slip back into depressive thoughts but its not as constant as before. Was just wondering if anyone else has used the alpha stim and if they have did longer use of it eradicate their depression completely?",3

Interesting read, curious what everyone's thoughts are on the article. Recently diagnosed with Dysthymia w/ anxiety, I've been suffering through this for years but only started getting help in the last year. I'm on my 4th antidepressant (zoloft, wellbutrin, lexapro, effexor) now with no success. Additionally i've always been curious if for example SSRI's are the first line in medication assisted treatmeant and the theory is to boost levels of serotonin then why aren't blood samples tested to check what an individuals baseline levels are vs. 2 months later when it reaks peak plasma levels VS. baseline levels of individuals who are not depressed?",3

"I just need to vent and I'm all alone. 

2017 started off as a great year. I had a good job, had a great girlfriend, no debt, bought a new car, had a nice apartment. You name it and I had it. Then it all fell apart. 

I feel so alone, I went from everything one day to absolutely nothing the next. I asked my girlfriend of two years to talk because she has struggled with depression and I felt that she was slipping into a spell so I was trying to help her. Turns out she was miserable and decided that day that we were going to break up and that she was moving out of our apartment that week. She left and I haven't seen or heard from her since.

Then I started drinking and realized how alone I really am. I don't have family, I don't have friends. The one friend I did have I screwed up because of my drinking. I just feel alone.

I got demoted at work. Had to start paying for an apartment meant for two by myself. I just had no one to talk to and I still don't. 

I've tried traveling and that doesn't make me any happier. I've tried going out by myself but I just can't talk to people or make friends. I feel damaged as a person. I feel like I've lost everything that makes me a real person. I can't even meet people. I talk to strangers or people who seem interested in talking to me and we get along well, but as soon as the conversation stops that's it. I've gotten numbers from girls to go out and never hear back from them. I've got numbers from guys to try and meet and hang out to try and be social and I never hear from them either.

I hate my job, I hate the city I live in, I hate how I look, I hate my inability to talk to people, but mainly I hate myself. I ruin everything I touch, I am never enough for anyone, and I am never wanted by anyone. 

I try to keep a pretty positive attitude but each day it gets harder and harder. I can't stand to look at myself, I don't even know who I am. Each day I feel more and more like I am not worth anything, that my life just isn't worth it. I wish each day to just not wake up. Each hour sitting at home in the darkness pushes me closer and closer to actually killing myself. I try to hold on, I try to push myself to see the bright side but I can't. 

My best friend doesn't talk to me, my other closest friend hates me. Every person I know that was friends with my ex and I constantly bring her up and how shes so much happier now. And to top it all off I just found out that she is now engaged. We dated for a bit over two years and it just ended. Just so abruptly. And now 9 months later shes engaged.

It kills me to think about. It physically hurts. I feel like throwing up, I'm an anxious mess; but I have no one to talk to about this. Now I'm sitting alone at work for the new years. No one is wishing me a happy new year, no one is caring that I make it home tonight, no one would even know If I killed myself.

Just when do things get better? I hate feeling worthless, I hate feeling like a burden to everyone around me, I hate being alone. I hate the feeling of not wanting to live anymore but honestly it's the only comforting thought.",2
"I'm not a strong person. At all. I've had an ok life, but I was coddled and overprotected for the majority of it. Now I'm 22 and every time something happens to me, I tell myself that I would honestly rather die than fixing it. 

I'm pretty obese, and my roommate tells me that I need to lose weight. I honestly would much rather put a shotgun under my chin and end everything. I don't want to work for anything, I don't really want to put effort into my life, especially when I already hate it so fucking much. I drink about 2-4 energy drinks a say too, so I'm pretty much just waiting for a heart attack to happen. 

I don't know why I'm posting in here. If you think that wanting to kill myself over these things is stupid, then you can honestly fuck right off. I'm sick of being told that, and the only thing that does is make me want to end it all even more.",1
"Hi everyone, I should've done a throw away account. 

I found this subreddit recently and I'm not sure where to start exactly. Not sure if this is even the right place. I just have this feeling of general loss, I'm 22 turning 23 in June. I live at home with my dad, I have no idea where my mom is, and that's fine. My parents went through a 8+ year divorce and I think it messed me up. I was 8 at the time, my mother was incredibly abusive to us. I still remember her choking my sister over the bathroom tub. It's something I don't think I'll ever forget. I spent those 8 years constantly moving from house to house apartment to apartment. I finally just stopped unpacking my things 

I was always described as the happy kid. Of course I was happy, I was fat as fuck. I had to smile or I probably would've killed myself in middle school, I certainly told myself enough times I was going to. Kids are fucking ruthless. I think it's fair to say I cried a lot up until high school. I lost that weight in high school, busted my ass and made something of myself. But now all I ever hear is how I'm not happy and that everyone misses the dacotah that was happy. I think they really just miss the dacotah that they could pick on without repercussions. I'm not sure how to feel about it all, if I'm not expressing a feeling of loss I just feel numb.

 I have problems expressing myself, or so I'm told. My college roommates used to call me emotionally detached. My girlfriend at the time thought so too, eventually they all just pushed me out of their life. I spent the 2nd half of the year alone in my dorm. 

I've never had the heart to call somebody out on their shit or get mad at somebody. I just end up mad at myself and wishing for that brief moment of misery to be over. My girlfriend, god bless her, has been supportive through these last couple months but she doesn't fully get it, and I don't know if I could ever explain it all. I love her to death and I hate the look on her face when I'm upset, nobody should ever have to worry about me.

In the 5 or 6 years since my sister ran away I have done nothing but watch my father fall into a pit of alcoholism. He's pushed everyone away from him and his problems only get thrown or deflected on me. He blames me for all of his misery, the divorce, the money. Which of course only opens opportunities for me to get confronted further. He would bitch me out and threaten to kick my ass, he'd pass out and I'd pick him up.  He'll apologize the next morning say he didn't mean it and do it again the next week. He actually did this again recently, he apologized but I've never wanted to be further from him. I'm not sure if he even remembers what all he has said. I haven't had the heart to tell him all the disgusting things he's said to me but it's really killing me knowing how he really feels. 

I know how to play instruments and I don't consider myself an idiot, I'm sure I have some smarts. I was always a busy person, writing for blogs, testing supplements for muscle tech, playing shows or just general choir engagements. I work for a cleaner service currently and I'm miserable. I thought working with things instead of people would help me. Instead I spend my time sweating my ass off while my 50 something coworker just supervises and judges everything I do.

Guys I'm just gonna stop for today

"So, I want to share my thoughts about this year.

This year I failed nearly all of my classes, for the fifth time. I finally admitted that I am depressed. I also finally admitted that I have gender dysphoria. I started therapy, which is not going well so far. No improvements. I realized that no matter how much I analyze myself and my problems, I will never be able to solve them.

 I spent almost all of my days lying on my bed, doing absolutely nothing but staring to the ceiling. I gained weight. I am already overweight. I exercised less. I read almost nothing. I didnât even play video games.

I have no friends, I made no friends, and I finally lost my only friend. She wasnât reaiiy putting effort, I was making all the plans, and we met only twice, the whole year. I donât think she liked me, she just hung out with me because she didnât want to be rude.

As I said, I started therapy, and I realized that I have gender dysphoria. I have bigger problems. I have lots of bad personality traits. Lots of bad habits. Lots of stuff that HAS to be changed. I wasnât able to make any change.

I . I spent days thinking about it. How it is going to affect me. My days are precious. And I did nothing with them. I was so scared that I will lose them, I wasted them myself.

I lost all my desires, dreams and interests. I had some hobbies that would make me feel fulfilled, no matter how I felt. I stopped doing them. I realized that things are not going to get better. I should stop trying.

I started to hurt myself. I singed my fingertips. I whipped myself with a belt. I hit myself. I scratched myself. Because I am a bad person. I am unable to change how I feel, how my life goes, or how I think. I am powerless. I have no ability to make a difference.

I am not suicidal. There is only one âthingâ that can push me to it. I am prepared to do it painlessly. Unless this âthingâ happens, I am not going to do it. I just hope that I will be able to do it, when the time comes.

So, it got worse this year. Its going to get even worse, I can bet on it. I failed my family. I failed at my life. I failed myself. I totally screwed up. I am responsible for everthing I did, and mostly, everything I didnât do.",3
"Another NYE alone..That makes 5 in a row.  Some were due to work, others my depression.  Just last week, my girlfriend of 2 years left me.  She left me to have an affair with her MARRIED co worker.  She told me she had no more time to waste on me and that she had moved on and did so a long time ago.  She just stayed with me because she felt bad for me.  These are all her words.

I know you are all probably thinking...""here comes some guy who just got dumped and he is feeling depressed so he comes here to bitch and complain.""  That is not the case.  I have had depression my whole entire life.  Im 28 and have been under serious treatment for about 4 years now.  

I have had my ups and downs, but mostly downs.  I was an alcohol and drug abuser but finally quit all of that to try and get better.  This was the first real relationship Ive ever had.  Even in HS and in college I never had someone just to call mine.  

Suicidal thoughts have swirled in my head for as long as I can remember.  At the height of my depression I began to self harm.  Nothing life threatening, but enough to draw blood and feel pain.  While this helped feelings subside a little bit...i always wished I had the balls to dig that razor in as deep as I could and just gashed up my arm.  But I am too much of a coward.

I want my life to be over...Im sick of hearing ""things are going to get better"" . ""try this new brand name medication that costs 500 bucks a bottle.""  ""youre a great guy just give it time""

I want this too be over.  I cant take this anymore...im alone, im tired im broken...but I cant find the courage and willpower to just..fucking...kill myself...

"im a 16 year old girl from england. 
ive attempted suicide 6 times in the space of (almost) 2 years because of school.
my head of year is supposed to help students with anxiety and let us sit outside her office but she just tells me to go away. i told her i was going to kill myself and she just told me to stop being dramatic. 

im feeling really suicidal right now, and i want to tell my mum because im scared im going to hurt myself, but sheâll just think im attention seeking.

 I don't know what's wrong with me. A bit before quitting I went into the er because I was suicidal and spent 4 days trapped and with no actual help. I faked being better to get out. My only friends were at this job and they're mad at me ( understandably ). My old roommates are holding some of my stuff hostage until I pay them a certain amount of money.

"I hate this. I want to feel better but I canât. You canât ask someone to kiss a spider if theyâre arachnophobic, yet the only advice I get from my peers is to âsnap out of itâ. 

My friends have always neglected and judged me, but there is nowhere else to go, and in a high school environment, I donât want to be that âlonely kid pretending he didnât exist during recessâ.

Iâm in a poor mental state, my mind is shrivelled and I want to hide forever. I donât want to give anyone the pain I feel right now. 

Iâm scared to tell anyone how I feel, people are so unpredictable I just donât know how theyâd react. I want help, but for me, itâs just hard. I donât know how to put it. 

I wish I could change, but it feels impossible.

"My boyfriend, a couple of his friends and a couple of my friends went out tonight to a bar. We were all kind of drunk and my boyfriend's friend asked a friend of mine if he take a shot from her belly button and she said no. He then asked me and u felt bad for him because he seemed really desperate, so I laid on the pool table and one of my friends poured the shot in my belly button and put a lemon in my mouth. He did the shot and then took the lemon out of my mouth with his mouth.


My boyfriend is very upset. I was buzzed and was just having a good time and I didn't mean anything sexual by it.


We have been dating for a couple of months.



What should I do to make things right with him? I love him a lot and only want to be with him. I tried talking to him and he gives me one word answers and walks away. I have been crying for the last hour and I don't know what to do. I have anger and emotional problems and I'm not sure what's wrong with me.


What should I do?

"As I was trying to fall asleep, I started to hear weird things coming from outside my bedroom. I heard creaking noises, noises that resembled the washing machine, and noises that vaguely reminded me of what it sounds like when my mom has her TV on. My mom wasn't home at the time for any of this, though. I had my bathroom's fan turned on to help me sleep(I usually do that), and I kinda heard all the extra noises through the fan noise if that makes any sense.

I guess my mind really is royally fucked.",3
"I was starting to feel low and burn out before New Years, and the evening allowed me to rise above my subjective perspective of myself and my interactions with people. I usually try not to party too hard *nudge nudge*, but it was a net positive I think. I reevaluated how I was doing and got a more complete view of psychological state.

I was also really happy to feel comfortable and actually see (as opposed to view a person through my preconceived notion) people a little more than I usually am able to.

Gender and Sexuality
===============
I grew up in a conservative environment, but I actually never felt ashamed of my gender or ashamed of my sexuality. I would get boy and girl crushes all the time and think nothing of it other than, ' oh this person is so cool and I really want to get to know them'. I was more effeminate and got bullied for it, including authority figures turning a blind eye or encouraging it. Pretty lame times that reinforced that people can be savage.

In expression and identity, I guess I was pretty androgynous growing. I never felt like I was a woman or that I wanted to be a manly man. I thought the gender binary people expressed themselves in was narrow and boring, so I kind of made a point to disregard it. 

Unfortunately, I have also learned that some people will not let you survive or function without expressing yourself in a way that they seem fit. I've experienced way too many people being openly hostile because of my mere existence. Today, I have to role-play as a bro just to survive in many professional environments. It feels degrading to my soul, but the trade off is I have some money. Its a bit emotionally exhausting and doesn't feel nice.

All in all, I am bi and not too happy with the prejudices people have in the world.


Socialization
==============
I am used to compartmentalizing my feelings. I have lost a great deal of friends who had either fallen off the face of the earth, OD'd, killed themselves, or had been too much grief to keep in contact with. I am craving close relationships and self-growth, but I am finding it difficult to meaningfully connect with people. I wonder if the feeling of abandoning other people because it is easier than being abandoned comes into play for me right now. I've felt that way in the past, but I thought I got over it. 

I am going to school and have had gainful employment, but it doesn't help me connect in the ways I seek. I socialize and feel like I am role-playing. Many friendships with people seem superficial and unfulfilling, and these are typically with normalish people. I don't have a problem putting myself 'out there' if I'm not down and out in a low period. I am social and have been told I am easy going and funny just as often as I've been told I can come across as a bitch without intending to or even saying anything (hah).

Despite what other people seem to think, I usually feel on-guard and can hardly be intimate / open up to folks. I think my memory is eroding due to long-term stress. What good is living life and collecting lessons from experiences if you can't remember them? What good is gaining perspective if you just lose it in a time of need? 

I'm uneasy not knowing people's motivations. I try to learn about people and what they want from me in an attempt to predict what may happen. 


Relationships
===============
I don't feel like I need to be in a relationship, but I do know that I need meaningful relationships. Although, it would be nice to find someone romantically that sees me for who I am and empowers me. Obviously, I have my doubts that I'll let anyone close enough to get the chance though.

Current partner was raised by a narcissist and is emotionally unavailable in a similar way as me. It is a comfortable yet emotionally unfulfilling relationship. I guess we're together out of a mutual need for physical intimacy and care? We care for each other, and she's incredibly gifted and into really cool stuff. We both value our space apart too due to similar issues.


The abridged version of my life:
================
As a child, I was very depressed due to life circumstances out of my control. Many of the relatives that I was close to straight up died, moved away, or quit speaking to me due to my parents' issues.

My parents made very unwise mistakes, fought often, and were not emotionally empowering. Purposefully went out of my way to not pick up their habits. Kind of felt a low-level mistrust of people since childhood due to bullying from other kids and abuse from authority figures. I liked books way more than people and read a lot. Most of my role-models were dead white guys haha.

High school was better, smoked weed and did somewhat engaging things with friends. Urban exploring, clubbing, extracurriculars, art, etc.

In spite of my world sucking, I was pretty motivated to leave and made decent grades. I qualified for a bunch of academic scholarships and went overseas. Found out the home was being foreclosed and the cars repossessed about midway through my year abroad. Traveled as much as I could and tried to not think too hard about returning to a state of no opportunities. Kinda spiraled into depression after realizing how good I was living abroad and how I would likely not see my new friends again.

At 16 I was thrust out into the world alone, ended up with little to no social supports or family due to my sexuality. It was also easier for my parents since they were struggling to get back on their own feet. Went around with a traveler friend I had made, riding trains and getting into trouble. Watched my travel buddy die of a heroin OD. Wound up in an abusive relationship on the coast. Pimped by someone older than me that I had been dating, experienced extreme stress and trauma due to some pretty bad influences in my life and feeling like there was no way out.

Eventually distanced myself from most of these horrible people, but I went through a period of agoraphobia where I wouldn't leave my apartment even if I ran out of food. Routinely disassociated and felt unable to connect to people.

Went on anti-psychotics for treatment resistant depression, basically strung out of my mind on benzos most of the day. Ditched the psych-meds and started meditating, doing shrooms, gradually meeting people. Got somewhat better, but I lost memories and cognitive functioning as a side effect of the anti-psychotics and benzos. Eventually returned to baseline (I think). Enrolled at a nearby school.

Started dating a guy who was diagnosed with NPD and in the marine corps. At first, his confidence and arrogance was endearing, and he was on frequent deployments which meant that we really valued the time we had together. Felt like I had a home for the first time in my life and actually loved. He was emotionally withdrawn, and I was also emotionally messed up to an extent. It worked out well enough. Was making a decent amount of money doing online stock trading and investing as well as taking classes online.

We would talk about our perspectives of the world. Goals. Ways to achieve our dreams. I designed our apartment and basically took care of his cats. Although I paid half the rent, I was kind of like expected to be a live-in nanny which wasn't too weird considering the shit I had gone through in life so far. He was a dom and we were both poly, so he would date basically my female-equivalent clones and we'd have threesomes (I would usually have shortish platinum blond haircuts and so would they). FWIW the sex with him pretty great even though he was kind of a sociopath.

After his contract with the military ended and he felt somewhat aimless, he began to cycle through emotions quickly and decided I wasn't worth his time. Literally a week after professing an extreme amount of love for me that he never felt before. He once described loving people like he would love eating a candy bar. That I had never done anything good for him. Really felt mind fucked - this wasn't a naive first relationship sorta deal. I even went with him to meet his parents once. It seriously felt like a deep relationship up until that point. 

Moved with friends to the bay, so did he. After a 6 month period of lackluster dating, we began an on and off again fuck-buddy relationship with that same guy. We agreed it would be purely physical, but he was trying to cross my boundaries. Eventually, I asked him to stay out of my life entirely. He told he had raped me after I passed out from GHB one evening bwfore either of us moved to the bay. I remember the incident vaguely, but I never opened my eyes and so just left it up to being something I imagined. Really screwed with me.

Best friend at the time was dating my partner, they ended up doing meth and being dicks. I cut them out of my life after they stoles from me. Not so funnily enough, my current best friend is being weird with my current partner - has been rejected by her and feels dissatisfied in his dating life. I feel like there is resentment being directed at me  and things are compounding on top of it. Too emotionally stressed to deal with it, so I am giving him space for awhile.

Had a crazy housemate situation where a couple made living at my space unbearable for me and 3 other housemates. We were all on the lease and couldn't evict them. I was stressed 100% of the time and never knew what they would do next. Can't really relax there even though they've been gone.

I am ashamed of what I have been through, but I try not to blame myself entirely for my life circumstances. A life without self-expression and enjoyment isn't a life worth living. I am sick of only surviving. I know something is wrong, but I don't have the tools to identify and fix it.

I've seen 6 different therapists - all ended up being useless, clueless, or offensive. Struggling to find a quality low income psych or therapists, but I am asking around.


*My living situation is tenuous and there is no long-term guarantee of housing. I also live in an extremely expensive area, and I don't have any social supports outside of here. Kind of feel trapped by this. 


Current thoughts
==============
I don't want to live a fear based lifestyle. 

I'd like to think that with all of my life experiences and trauma, I am not a complete basket case. I think I work much harder than most people to hold myself together. My worst fear is that I will become an emotionally reactive monster and permanently lose sight of the humanity of others. That my ability to rationalize and integrate my experiences will be lost forever. That I will be a scared, closed off, zombie for the rest of my life. It's really unnerving.

I've made so much progress over the last 5ish years to reach a point of relative stability, but it doesn't seem to be enough. I can't continue to expend so much energy on getting by. It's chipping at my will to live. With that being said, I'm not planning to make rash decisions. 


Some problems I have
==============
*Moody

*Typically pretty tense

*Tend to feel a level of stress at all times

*burn out after period of high stress leading to being withdrawn / unmotivated

*Have to fake being relaxed to interact with people in high stress periods (lots of projects, midterms/finals, relationship stuff)

*Memory is worsening

*Sometimes memories are hard to put in chronological order, not impossible - but it takes actual effort to piece together

*Sleep not restful

*Expect the worse from people, but I try to give them opportunities to prove me wrong 

*Sometimes impulsive when depressed, but I work pretty hard to control this - used to be caught up by by life's wayward distractions instead of introspecting 

*Sometimes experience anhedonia

*ADHD may be related

*Funnily enough, I don't feel safe being emotional around people sometimes",1
"So, long time lurker here. Pretty sure no one will respond. First off, Happy New Year's to everyone. As for me, I'm spending it alone in a NYC apartment that doesn't belong to me. Don't ask.

Anyways, I've been dealing with depression for a long time. First got diagnosed with it my senior year of high school. That was also the year I got suspended for drug use (I attended a boarding school), and subsequently got waitlisted at 5 top 20 schools that I would have got into if it hadn't been for my suspension. I hate myself for it. Just finished my first semester at a random, no-name college and it was pathetic. While I work two jobs, I isolated myself, and as a result, practically have no friends left. Always wondering what would of happened if I laid off the drugs in high school and got into a decent college.

"Lately I've been panicking over the realization that I'm dumb as a brick, and I haven't achieved anything in my life. 

I'm 20 years old and just got my first girlfriend. I guess this is the only major achievement of my life, as she is beautiful and smart. Amazed we actually connected. I constantly have a feeling she's going to leave me due to the fact I can't keep up with her. She has achieved so much. Scholarships, awards, friends, and more. 

I did nothing in my life. My teen years were spent playing videogames. I did anything and everything I could to waste time and make my life go by faster, because I assumed I'd be happier when I got older. Unfortunately I've realized that I should have used that time to train my brain and focus on grades/academic achievements. 

Now I'm as dumb as a brick. I have no career direction. I don't think I'd ever be able to work in a field that makes serious money. I still don't have any friends other than one online friend, and my girlfriend ( who has many real life friends ). I've never had any real life friends. 

I don't know what to do. My brain is already fucked. My memory is so bad. I feel like I've lost the ability to learn.  Once she realized I'm destined for failure, she's going to leave me. Then I'll be truly alone again. She already knows I'm not smart. ( not sure why this hasn't scared her off yet ) 

I can't take it. I hate feeling inadequate all the time.

"This is going to long guys..sorry. I've been a long time lurker and I've never posted. I've read all of your posts, shared tears and smiles with things that I identify with. It makes me feel both sad and happy to know I'm not alone. I've been depressed since I could remember. I used to be a happy and positive little girl until the first time I was bullied. Since, I've been bullied and made to feel like shit from so many people in my life. My low self-esteem began maybe when I was 6? I've been struggling with life since. I'm 25 and I haven't finished my degree. Why? Because I can't make myself do the work. I get motivated for the first month and say this year will be different and I fucking fall into depression again and I can't get out. I fear falling behind and when I do I fucking give up. I will get my degree this spring (finally). I've had to get academic withdrawals because of my depression. I feel like a failure while all the people I know are flourishing. My life needs to change.

I told my mom today that I want to make an appointment with a psychiatrist so I can get meds. I've depressed my entire life...and I've tried to deal with it but my life is shit and I know something needs to change. I called and made an appointment and I'm fucking scared. I don't want to talk to someone who will be internally judging my fucked up decisions and life. 

Then my mom has been acting bummed and I asked why. She said she doesn't understand. Her and my dad have given me all they could and it doesn't make sense why I'm sad. She's now sad and blaming herself. I've tried to tell them it's not their fault and they don't get it. I can't talk to them. 

I can't talk to my boyfriend. We've been together for seven years. We met in college and I was better with my depression and actually socialized. But the years carried on and he graduated and we've been long distance since. I lost my friends because they betrayed me or just found me so boring. My best friend stopped talking to me when I got a senator internship over her congressman one. She just stared at me when I told her and neither she or her family congratulated me. She stopped talking to me since then. That was three years ago. She was my last friend. Sine then, I don't hang out with anyone, except my boyfriend when he visits. We've been long distance for the last five years but after my best friend left me, I've been so alone. 

My boyfriend is the opposite of me. In college and after, he's that guy everyone loves. He can make friends with a freaking tree. He attracts people and he has many friends and is social. I'm the complete opposite. He has to beg to get me to come out with him and his friends, and if I do i always have to drink. It's the only way I can talk and not just sit their silent. He's seen me when I'm so depressed that I can't even get out of bed. The last year has been horrible for me. I've spent weeks just in bed... and I can tell he's getting tired of it. 

He keeps saying I bring up the past and the pain I've endured and I can't let things go. I want to I just don't know how. I don't trust people and I don't know how to carry on conversations anymore. I feel resentful he's so social and well liked. When I'm alone watching TV like any other fucking day, he's out and having fun. I want to but I can't. 

For New Years Eve, I saw he was with people (mostly girls) and I texted him saying ""are you spending new years with girls??"" He just said. ""not one, there are some here but I'm not with them."" I told him to ""well have fun."" He didn't call to say HNY or hasn't talked to me since. 

The past four days I had another depressive ""bender."" I just cried, slept, and stared at my ceiling. I couldn't even watch tv. I just go some motivation to do some shit. 

I'm hoping seeing the psychiatrist will help and I can get ADD and Anti-Depressants. Shit needs to change. 

I've just been writing down my thoughts. Sorrry this is so long. This is just 10% of what I wish I could say but I don't want to write a freaking 100 page essay.

I hope you'll all join me in posting the nastiest things you can think of about yourself or anyone. And direct it at 2017. Tonight, it deserves it more than you. Normal self-loathing service can be resumed tomorrow. It's gonna get dark.

* 2017, I hope you die in a house fire.
* 2017, if you ever have kids. I hope they get abducted.
* 2017, I hope you get not-quite terminal cancer in all of your toilet-parts and then get hooked on painkillers and end up selling your arse for heroin money as your family and friends look on and laugh.
* 2017, I hope all of your loved ones die in a car crash.
* 2017, you're not worthy of kindness.
* 2017, you deserve nothing.
* 2017, I hope you get pregnant and both you and your baby die in labour.
* 2017, I hope your dog stops loving you.
* 2017, I wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire. In fact the only time I'd even consider giving you any fluids is if you were in a burns unit, burnt from head to toe. I'd have a wank on you. And that's only if I had AIDS.

Lastly, fuck you, 2017. In a few hours you'll be dead. And I'll still be here. Even though I don't really want to be. I still beat you. And that counts for at least ...something. Probably. Maybe.

"So on boxing day, the people I live with (Dad, step mom, step sister and little brother) went to stay at my step moms dads as it's a bit of a tradition. So I went to my moms house.

Hopefully getting drunk... again...
So we invited the old man my mom looks after for dinner. We ate, he enjoyed it so did we all then after all that we took him home. Aftet that we went to the store and brought some echo falls, dissarrono ( can't spell for shit sorry ) and coke. I'm 16 so I gave my mom the money for it lol. 

So when we got home I decided to get pissed. Nearly drank the whole bottle of dissarrono in about an hour. Totally fucked. So my retarded self decided to have a breakdown and then tell my sister that I think about killing myself every day and night and that I hate my life so much. I was a mess. But she laughed while I was in tears. Funny right? I also pretend to slit my wrists with a fork which was the first thing I grabbed out of the cookery. Kinda wish I pulled out a knife. 

She didn't say a word about it in the morning nor did my mom who was upstairs trying to sleep. 

Few dayd past, family go to my step disters cousin's family party, so I go to my moms again, and decided to jam along to my music with my mom in the kitchen, it then got to the depressing music and it ended up my mom pretending to slit her wrists and said to me ""No wonder you've been feeling depressed listening to this shit"" I wish I said to her that it helps me or some crap like that. Fun right?

Got another post coming up in a bit aswell about my most recent fuck up.

Fuck this new year. ,3
"I remember the first time I ever had suicidal thoughts, it was 4 years ago and I was living away from home for university. I remember coming home that weekend and breaking down in front of my parents straight away. That experience was horrifying especially because the thoughts were really severe and that was the start of me being depressed.

Now, 4 years later I have periods of severe depression where these thoughts come up again. However, now whenever I get these thoughts I am able to keep them to myself for an extended period of time and just carry on as normal. A major difference between then and now is that I actually want to die now whereas before that thought was completely alien to me. 

My desire to die is pretty strong right now mainly because I am scared about the new year and the last few months have gone really shit. I love my family so much but I feel like my anxiety and depression is going to win very soon. 

I was thinking of going to my old therapist and showing her my diary with all of my suicidal thoughts with the intention of getting hospitalised but that comes across like attention seeking and that I don't really have a desire to die. Part of me doesn't want to go and show it to her but then another part really does. She is the only one I would show this to. 

I am a coward though and don't really have the fearlessness needed to actually commit suicide which is another negative for me. 

Sorry for the long post!

What do you guys think?

"Normally i feel threatened by ''good-looking'' people and such. But when they show weakness or some traits that i deem not good, weak whatever, i get a feeling of disdain for that person. 
It's almost never on an even level. I am better or worse than someone. Anyone familiar with this?",1
My friend is mad at me because of my mental state. Ive lost 2 friends so far and I think the end is near,1
"Within the last month, she has lost her best friend and her grandmother, who she was very close with (both passed away). This time last year, she was involved in an incident where she was assaulted (we were not dating at the time), and it is bringing up some bad memories for her. She is continuously mentioning about moving cities on her own, and she keeps insisting she is fine. I'm the only support she has, please help !",1
"Grades. Looks. Achievements. Medals. Friends.

The inferiority complex. That second word ... the word carries so much weight

It's like an endless competition against the world. 

Every day, every minute, every breathe, it feels like a competition.

A gladiator match. A Hunger Games type of feel.

It's a big war on who has the biggest dick.

Every minute, I compare with others about everything.

How managed to get what they wanted at a much earlier age than I do. 
How they manage to get a hold of their own life but I ever did. 

How much I keep comparing grades *(which is my greatest weakness because I focus on it too much on a daily basis but I end getting bad grades anyway because my anxiety keeps killing me ... makes me procrastinate and black out and give up)*

Every day I am shaking the minute I wake up. 

Every day, I feel like I have this need, this compulsion, this must to be better than everyone else in every way ... but I am too weak. 




I am paralysed in that endless competition against others and everyone else in this world goddamned planet and at the same time, I lack the slighest motivation to even do the slightest change because I give up before I even do anything because I have an inferiority complex, one that I feel like I am an ant among giants or gods.

*(or when I did make a move to be better, I pushed so much that it took over my life. An obsession that became so invasive and destructive that instead of my mind verbally and psychologically abusing me in one way, I allowed it to abuse me in a different way. When I did want to make a change, I went too far and it became dysfunctional)*

In my head, I feel like I am at war. I feel like I am in an endless bloody nightmare against my own head. Sometimes, I even lay down my arms before it starts because I am too exhausted and fed up of fighting over and over and over and over again.

On the outside, I feel frozen. I am shaking every day. Even right now, I am shaking because I am constantly being reminded on how much of a pathetic, weak and ungrateful little bastard I am because no matter how much I try, no matter how much I wanted to push myself, I never am able to do it.

When I try to be better, I fuck up. I panic, I feel like giving up, I feel like I running through a battlezone where there are a thousand bombs exploding everywhere, terrified as hell. I feel little and weak and scared.

I feel like I am walking on a thin rope but I am shaking because I am scared. 

I feel like a thousand voices are screaming inside my head constantly all the time. They make me shake even more and because of that, I end up falling

Again. And again and again.

Sometimes, I even fall on purpose because I want to hurt myself because even though I have that compulsion to be better, I give up immediately.

It's like when there is a bully who is about to beat me, I beat myself instead just to save the time and energy and because I deserve it.

So I do that over and over and over again. From the minute I wake up. Every minute, I feel like I am in a battle between myself and my self hatred and more often than not, my self hatred wins.

So I beat myself. Over and over again.

And then I keep noticing how much I hate myself and because of that, I feel pathetic. I feel despicable.

And when I compare myself to others, that is the perfect fuel to add to the fire that is already burning me from the inside while I am tied up with my mouth shut.

I sit on my chair or stay on my bed, staring at the wall, or looking at the paper that I am supposed to write. I end up staring at it for hours, because I even lack that tiniest skills or the tiniest effort to push myself to even do it. But even if I did try, I know that I don't want to ""just try"", I want to go all out. 100%. ... No, 200%. 300%. I want to be the best. The best of the best. But I feel pathetic either way. So, I don't do much effort. 

So I get bad grades or fail .... another perfect fuel to the fire. 

My mind feels like it hit the gold mine. It has the perfect tools to make its bitch. It has me chained like an animal and it slaps and belittles every minute.

I look at others, I don't see people, I see numbers and qualities, those who have beaten me, those who I need to beat, those who I am already better than them and those who I absolutely can never beat.

All of them, my mind will still find ways to make its bitch even more.

**""He has got better hair than you do. His genes are better than yours. You cannot possibly be better than him""**

**""That girl will never lay eyes on you and accepts you as a friend or even a boyfriend. She has got eyes on that other hot piece of ass right there. I bet she is making out with him while you are too busy trying to control your anxiety""**

**""That competition who stole the girl you liked, he is probably much more of a man than you are in every way. I bet they just love to have wild sex together, making you feel like a wimp that you already are""**

**""Look at you. More Ds and Es. Of course you are gonna get those grades. You can bet your ass that you are gonna keep trying to get better grades but you already know that I am always there to stop you. No matter how much you try, I'll always find a way to beat you. And no matter how hard you try to focus during the exam, you can never focus because I am always there. No matter how hard you try, there is always a genius much, much better than you""**

____________________________________________________

Every day I go through this. Every day I have to put up to this. Every day I have to keep on going through this torture.

A world like this one, a world where everyone is constantly competing against each other, whether it is people competing for more likes on social media, or competing who has the higher grades or more income, or who has the better girlfriend and has the better sex, or has the happiest life, or who is more successful and able to beat his competition, or who is able to get the job he wants and the rest keep struggling and maybe even end up poor, a world where misery has become a means of humouring people like social media likes to poke fun of other people's flaws and failures, or the news likes to cause drama and panic when someone makes a mistake or something happens, no matter how big or small, or teachers and parents or people in charge, telling you what to be or not to be, how to dress, eat, drink and write, what to think or not to think, how you should be or not be. 

Plenty of people around, often looking for whatever faults and regrets and flaws you have, so that they could exploit it and take advantage of it and make you worse, 

Not to mention the internet, how much it is so full of trolls and cyber bullies who want to make you feel like you are the worst person on the planet, just because they can ....

 ... just the right kind of drug to give this bully, this abusive mind of mine that I was somehow chosen to have with me on a daily basis, the right kind of negativity and anxiety and torture to make me feel like I sold my soul to the devil and I deserve all that suffering.

That constant anxiety. That constant terror.

It is so much easier to just grab the rope and end it right there. 

Why would you choose to keep experiencing this day by day, night after night?

______________________________________________________________

Even right now, as I am typing this, I am reading and re-reading what I wrote, I am constantly shaking, I cannot think clearly and my mind is keeping a sharp eye on whatever spelling mistake or grammatical error or how much I sound like a person whose language are as poor as a mentally retarded person because his anxiety is so high everyday that he cannot think clearly at all, that mind is like a bully behind me, waiting to strike when I am at my most vulnerable. When I feel ashamed for a mistake that I made. When I am reminded about a past grade that I wished I could have done better. When I lost someone who cared about to someone else.

I often wish that I could grab a gun and shoot myself in the head. Maybe I will make that voice in my head shut up once and for all, but then again, it will still win anyway. Suicide is for cowards and pussies anyway ... and it calls me a coward and a pussy everyday.

If I keep breathing air in this damned planet, it will find a way to make me suffer and win anyway in the end. If I just end it, it will win either way. 

It's like fate has already decided isn't it? It's as if fate has put a curse on me and I cannot do anything about it",1
"I have a long story but don't feel like giving all the details right now..

I graduated high school 6 months ago. I was supposed to move elsewhere and work for about a year before deciding whether I should go to college. Those plans didn't take place, so... I've been staying at home since then.

Yet, long before that (Perhaps for the past 2 or 3 years), I've been really declining, just barely passing my classes and even failing calculus twice. Slowly spiraling into depression although I was never  sure until now.
And now that I'm out.. I'm pretty much depressed. So many things that stress and worry me. I can never get anything done, I never feel interested in anything, I always feel tired.. And yet my mom has kind of been pushing me into getting a job while the move situation gets resolved. It really seems like the right thing to do.
Yet the idea just feels terrifying. Like I KNOW I should find one, bu I also dread the idea. Probably my anxiety acting up, but also because I worry it'll only make me worse. I'm constantly on-edge and just about anything can ruin my mood for the rest of the day. In my mind, I tell myself that I'm in no condition to work full-time but then I feel guilty because that might just be an excuse.  
And just a few minutes ago, a cousin messaged me saying there was a spot I could take at a hotel that he works at. And again.. That feeling of dread, the guilt for even feeling like this, and overall just wanting to decline but not knowing how to say it.
Thoughts? ",2
"Hi there, I'm here really just looking for some help, not for me specifically, but for a friend, or maybe help for me on how to help her. Warning, this is going to be kinda long.

Freshman year of college, I met an amazing girl in my major. Smart, outgoing, an athlete, and she subscribed to my quirky/dark humor. We actually hooked up pretty much right after meeting, I thought I was in love. We fooled around for most of freshman year, I thought things were going great.

Turns out things were not going great. I always felt something was kind of off with her, she would always get this vacant look in her eyes whenever we were fooling around, she was like a different person. As it turns out, she was assaulted in high school, and it really messed with her. She basically lost the ability to say ""no"" but at the same time hated herself for it, she she shut herself away while things happened and then dealt with the personal fallout later. She finally just kinda swore off sex at the beginning of sophomore year. That was her band-aid. I fear she's still fighting a losing battle though.

She isn't sleeping well, she's hiding away from people more and more every day. She gets mad at me for trying to get too close. She's scared to let herself have any fun, to go out and party because she's afraid that she'll fall back into old habits, and she can't afford to do that anymore. She has pretty vivid nightmares regularly. I've witnessed one, they're fucking awful. I didn't want to touch her and influence her dream, but I had to keep her from thrashing into desks. Lose-Lose situation.

She says she's smart enough that she knows suicide isn't the answer for her, but I know she has lapses in judgement, I know she has made attempts in the past, or at least plans for attempts. I'm just afraid everything is just going to get worse, that shes going to keep having these lapses and shes going to get closer and closer.

I just want some help, some advice. I want to know how to make sure I don't lose one of the few people in this world I truly care about. I wonder if any of you have been in similar situations, either mine or her's, and what kinds of steps you have taken.   ",1
"I should have done this a long time ago.

Let me begin by saying that I am a proud man.  I like to think I'm self-sufficient, and that I'm equipped to deal with the crap the world throws at me.  I'm not accustomed to asking for help, especially when it comes to my illness.  You see, no one in my family knows I suffer from chronic depression, because I have never been diagnosed as such.  But the truth is I've spent the majority of my entire life battling self-loathing, feelings of hopelessness, and thoughts of suicide.  And as I slog through what must certainly be a mid-life crisis, it's getting harder and harder to deal with on my own.

I am very slight of build, and I was bullied mercilessly as a child and teenager.  I learned to fight back, and have spent most of my life unwilling to put up with others' crap.  That has really hurt me socially and professionally, because everyone thinks I'm an asshole.  I'm now in my 40s, and I don't have any friends anymore, and don't really have much to do with my family, other than my mother.  I love her, and she loves me, but she's a tyrant.  She has supported me financially for years, and she's not afraid to remind me of that at every opportunity.  She's approaching her 70s now, and her health is deteriorating, leaving me as the only member of the family who would even consider caring for her (everyone else in my family draws disability or welfare, even though they're each perfectly capable of working, but none of them would lift a finger to care for my mother, so that falls on me).

I went to college, where I did very well.  I have a bachelors degree in music education, but after graduating I discovered fairly quickly that I can't stand children (much less their overbearing parents).  So I am now thousands of dollars in debt (student loans) that I can't afford to pay, all for a degree in which turned out to be a waste of time. I was never a particularly stellar performer, so that avenue is closed to me as well.  However, I've spent the past 20 years writing and arranging music for school bands and band instruments in a bid to validate going to college in the first place and salvage some sort of professional career, and some dignity.  Unfortunately, composing and arranging pays little to no money...certainly not enough to pay bills or better myself.  The truth is, I'm an outcast in that world, because again, I'm not afraid to speak my mind, and I'm not afraid to tell music teachers when they're not doing a good job.  So I feel that door has closed as well.

Since graduating college, I've had to resort to what amounts to a string of odd jobs which I've absolutely hated.  Customer service, human resources, retail, grocery, sales....all soul-crushing, tedious jobs that have always made me feel like a complete and utter failure in life, and wishing that writing music was a sustaining career.  

About 10 years ago, I got involved in a relationship with a woman who nearly ruined my financially.  It took me a long time to bounce back from that, but I did.  I had to move back home, though.  Unfortunately, since then, I've had an incredibly difficult time finding work at all.  I live in the rural south, where the only good paying jobs are in nursing and truck driving (neither of which I can do, nor would ever want to).  I can't even get a job flipping burgers or working in a grocery store, because I'm a man in my 40s with a degree, and am (according to employers and staffing managers) overqualified for anything short of, according to them, brain surgery.  Factories won't hire me for the same reason (and also because I cannot lift more than 40 pounds).  I'm subscribed to dozens of different job websites, and can't count the number of times I've nearly been scammed by fraudulent job listings...the sort that prey upon desperate people like me.  I've wasted thousands of dollars in gasoline driving to places of business in order to apply, only to be told ""You have to apply online"", and am then ridiculed by friends and family who assert ""You have to go meet employers face to face if you want to get hired"".  

In the past I've actually moved around the country in order to find work, but I've always been held back by 1). There's no such thing as a permanent full time job anymore, and 2). The extremely high cost of living, and anyway, as my mother gets older, that's no longer an option.  I'm stuck here, and I'm going broke.  If it weren't for my mother, I would be homeless, and just a few days ago she informed me that ""we're"" moving from a decent house in a quiet neighborhood to a mobile home next to a railroad....the last thing in the world my ego and self-esteem need right now.

I don't have health insurance.  I can't even afford it.  The state I live in doesn't offer Medicaid,  the premiums are too expensive on even the cheapest plans, and the copays at my local health department are too expensive.  My student loan is on deferment until they get tired of me requesting deferments (which may very will be next month).  I've been dealing with internal and external hemorrhoids for a decade, and I can't afford even have them looked at, much less do anything about it.  And I certainly can't afford therapy, or counseling, or medication for this depression.   Coupled with the fact that I don't even want to get out of bed most days, combined with the fact that I'm not getting any younger...I'm beginning to see the writing on the wall.

I'm a proud man.  I don't like to ask for help.  I don't want to apply for welfare or financial assistance, because 1). I most likely wouldn't qualify for it, and 2). to me, that's admitting total defeat, and surrendering any shred of dignity I have left.  I certainly don't like to ask for help from strangers on the internet, because frankly, I think it's a total waste of time and effort.  But I can feel a darkness creeping up on me, preparing to strangle the very life out me.  I see no hope for a future.  It just makes me so angry.  I don't drink, I don't do drugs, I've stayed out of trouble, and I don't bother anyone.  I worked very hard to better myself and, for my part, I've been a good person.  I don't care about money or wealth.  I just want a sense of purpose in life.  I want to be able to pay my bills and actually buy things I want rather than just what I need.  I want to be respected for my talents, and maybe even remembered when I'm gone.  But all of that seems totally out of reach now.  It's infuriating to see my suggested earning potential on job sites ($89,000 per year, btw), and then get a prospectus from Social Security letting me know that as of right now, when I turn 65 I'll only get $330 a month.  That makes it feel like everything, my education, my work history, my entire life...has all been for nothing.

I don't know what to do.  I applied for over 20 jobs today, and I won't hear back from a single employer because I'm a forty-something with a college degree.  I'm tired of being supported financially by my ailing mother.  I want to support HER.  I want to be able to afford an apartment at the very least, and not have to move into a damn trailer less than 20 feet from railroad tracks.  I want her to be proud of me.  I want my college professors to be proud of me.  I want to be proud of myself.  

But part of me also wants off this ride.  Part of me is afraid things are not going to get better.  How can they?  I'm running out of ideas.  I'm running out of options.  And I'm running out of patience.  I just don't know what else to do.

"My fiancÃ© is the one who I talk to most about how Iâm feeling and is the one who encouraged me to ask my mom for help, but I had no idea how to break the news to her. My whole life she has talked about how my dad was always so bad because he was bipolar and didnât take his medication so I always associated bipolar disorder to raging, abusive behavior and Iâm not like that at all. I didnât want her to either belittle my feelings or freak out. Then one night I got drunk and I canât even remember how it got brought up, but I remember ugly crying to my mom about how over the past almost 5 years something has changed with me mentally and Iâve been having suicidal thoughts that have increased with time. Iâve always been depressed feeling and I self harmed when I was a teenager, but it was never like this. I think child birth triggered something because this all started with the intense sadness after having my first son (Iâm assuming it was Postpartum Depression, but I never reached out. I was ashamed.) but the suicidal thoughts have increased over the past year and a half and I feel the shift in the manic and depression phases. Even my friends think Iâm ignoring them because I go from chatty and outgoing to MIA for weeks.

"Iâm not relatively new to depression, as I have been suffering from it for nearly 3 years now.

I donât really need any consoling or anything. Iâm not considering ending my life because I have no reason to. I am fully aware these thoughts are the depression and not my true thoughts. 

I donât need help as I can still maintain control.

"It sucks because a flaw about your personality can easily be fixed and I doubt it has a strong impact. Being reminded constantly of body flaws is the worse in my opinion because that can just ruin someone completely. It just hits you in the heart because that's what everyone views you as.

"Nothing Happens


Staring at the white wall I trace the rectangular patterns with my wet eyes and the pain strikes me again along with the voices. âGaby, youâre such a fuck up why are you even alive?â I cover my ears while I shake my head repeatedly. I lose control. In a plane falling out of the sky what can one do but brace for death? Every negative happening thatâs ever happened is replaying in my head, spun around where Iâve become the problem. The angle of death. The one thing that makes sure everything goes wrong. I see this seemingly true image of myself and I feel disgusted. The voices start yelling ugly words at me digging at my festering wrists. They wanna see blood but I wont give it to them. My whole body shaking, little puddles of tears on the floor, eyes like a madwoman the voices start screaming. Banging my head against the wall until my fight for survival becomes a fight for death I slump down, my head throbbing with a sharp pain in my skull. I laugh.

7) Despite the many compliments I receive at work, I feel they are fake and undeserved. I'm the owners son, and I know I'm a great guy, but I will always have the lingering doubt that people are nice because 'they have to be' and I'll never know who's honest.

8) Despite these compliments I'm still a kissless virgin

9) I'm so goddamn lonely.

10) I'm so lonely. I just want someone to be with.

11) I have plenty of good friends and an amazing, extremely supportive family, but for some reason, I'm still so fucking lonely.

12) I just want the lonely to go.

13) I want someone to hug me without me asking for it. I hate how I have to keep looking for attention.

14) I sent out happy new years to my closest friends and they haven't written shit back to me.

15) I'm really tired.

Alot of good things have happened this year; don't get me wrong. I've come to know a lot people and realized just how supportive my family is. But mentally, I just can't shake off this incredible feeling of worthlessness and loneliness.

"The person i loved was always there for me.. sacrificed her own time for me if i needed her..i was only a slefish stoner that smoked everyday.. at the end of our relationship i was taking the time we were spending together for granted.. long story short she ended up doing some mean things.. and after that i fucked up even more and nailed the coffin shut.. i hate myself everyday for doing the things i did.. spontaneous actions with obvious consequences i ignored.. i wake up and i go to sleep crying pretty much every night.. i have this really strange feeling when i wake up, almost like a tingling eapecially in my hands.. i have some fun moments but the negatives always outway the positives and seems forever lasting.. i dont feel like seeing what the future holds because everything always seems to turn out to be nevative no matter what...",3

And the one person, my best friend, who i can turn to and try to feel assurance that my fucked up life isnât a waste, is on lockdown with her parents. No phone, no internet, no contact with the outside world.

"Over the last year I have felt like my life was just getting worse and worse. I left my fiance in November of 2015, which is a long story but it boils down to I always felt like I was never enough in her eyes. I felt like she was emotionally abusive, so I left. For a time I seemed to be happy. I had just gotten out of the military (note this story has nothing to do with trauma from the military) and I moved back to my home town so I could finally see my friends and family regularly again. All seemed like it was going well. I got a job at the local hospital, I'm currently living with my sister so that's helping with money. I just feel like I'm a shell of the person I was before I met my Ex. I don't know how to be happy anymore and I don't even remember what it feels like to experience true elation for something. I use to love writing or reading, I can barely do both anymore. This is the most I've written, and meant it, in a long time. I took some of those online tests, just a minute ago, to tell me if it was possible that I was depressed. Everyone of them said, ""You are likely Severely Depressed"". This feels like I'm just ranting but I needed to tell someone this and this seemed like the only spot to put this down.",1
"Wow, now that's Not how to start 2018. I work an office-type of a job, which has a lot of communication to do with tourists. My job is tied with issuing a lot of invoices. But today, I made about $3,000.00 worth of financial damage to the company. What's even more sad is that me and my boss, which is a great guy btw, we don't really get well along, and today he welcomed me being very happy himself! It was a very happy moment. I'm a kind of an awkward guy when it comes to communication with my boss. My awkwardness comes from severe anxiety I've evolved from childhood, because everyone was treating me bad, even strangers. It makes me happy when my boss approaches me being happy. But today, I had a lot of important invoices to issue, and screwed each and every one of them. My boss was furious. He shouted at me a lot. Now I'm at a point where I think it's either better to kill myself, or ask him to fire me. My sole point is to not have him be angry. If he's happy, I'm happy. I know, this is really weird now that I'm thinking about it. It's the same way with family. Now I'm behind my desk, alone and hoping to be alone until the end of the workday to go home, and either beat myself to sleep, or cry the soul out of me.
Anyways, because it's New Year's, he decided to handle the problems and remain happy. I can't apologise, they are mistakes I cannot un-do. However, after the storm ended, I appear to still feel a crippling depression. At one point I was considering suicide as a proper way to deal with this situation. Hear me out, I don't have a lot in my life. Anytime I try to succeed a plan, I always fail. Only thing I have in my life is my family to care about. I'm the only man in the house, and I'm still very young. Nobody, but me, could take care of my family, and this makes it impossible to travel anywhere. I feel as if I'm critically handicapped towards achieving happiness. It kills me from the inside. Everyday I strive to make myself happy from little things. But they are temporary.",2

I want to give up. Whatâs the use in fighting. I tell people Iâm âgoodâ or âokayâ and they donât notice.

"Been having on and off waves of depression since 10th grade and just a total, consistent lack of motivation to put effort into anything. I dropped out of collage after the first semester and now I just work to keep myself afloat mentally. I just don't care enough about anything to get myself moving forward. All my relationships fail because I'm just not emotional and block everything out. New Year's Eve drank myself unconscious and now I'm back to my depressed self and self harming again. I hate myself for not being able to get though it and I'm afraid my life will just be passive and grey.

"These are goals I want to keep for at least the first month of January. I'm going to be able to seek out therapy again now that I'll be living in Seattle for the rest of the year instead of bouncing between Seattle (work/school) and home for holidays.

*-I am done with talks of suicide with my loved ones.*

I understand it is so stressful to have a partner or a daughter or friend who just shuts down every other night and says she wants to die. Even though I tell everyone I will not kill myself because I couldn't bear traumatizing anyone, I know telling them I want to die isn't helping me or them. It's time for me to put away suicide as my cry for help. If I really feel low I know the folks at /r/SuicideWatch are comforting and I frequent the sub to offer support as well. They get me. I will probably share with my will-be therapist as well instead of family and friends because they are not my therapists. Brings me to my next goal.

*-Stop treating family and friends as therapists.*

And by this I mean dumping my existential crises on everyone is not okay. They don't know how to help. I shouldn't expect them to help. I need real counseling from someone with experience and someone who can actually listen without getting burnt out from me. I know everyone needs a shoulder to cry on. But I am chronically depressed and anxious and I am always asking for far too much when I ask for shoulders to cry on. I am asking for shoulders to cry on for hours long. It's not good for anyone.

*-I will take care of my body.*

I notice differences in my mood when I eat unhealthy and my binge eating only worsens this. Regardless if depression makes me binge eat or if binge eating makes me depressed, I need to clean my diet up. I did a really good job of this last summer and I believe I can do it again. I can do this.

*-I will believe in myself.*

No more negative talk downs. I have to believe I can be better than who I was. I have to believe I can be better. I want to see myself as better. Maybe depression will never go away. But I have to learn to cope sustainably. I have to stop giving up at every mountain and wall and obstacle.

*-I will expect care from myself and only myself.*

No more dependence on others. I need to become more independent because I am very attached and attach easily.

Maybe a lot of this sounds like keeping things inside and bottling up. But I want to be as transparent as I can when it is appropriate instead of when it is inappropriate. I want to talk to a therapist exclusively about deep personal woes. I can tell a friend about a bad day sure. But my deep issues are really too spoken of too often these days and I know it needs to stop.

"I just don't fucking see how the majority of people aren't fucking poor in the first place. I'm nearly fucking homeless, just barely making it by the skin of my teeth, with little to nothing going for me, with mounting debts, and somehow the majority of fucking people aren't dealing with this shit. I just don't fucking get it. How on Earth did my life turn out to be so fucking shitty, yet somehow most of everyone else is doing way better than me. I know a lot of people in my situation too. I see 'em all around and it's like we're fucking invisible. Nobody gives a shit about us and nobody fucking thinks that the fact that you can end up in this fucking situation in this goddamn country is bad enough to warrant massive change. No one thinks it's a fucking problem because it's only a million or two out of a couple hundred million. In fact, it fucking disgusts me that the majority can just write off ANY human life so easily. 

Bad fucking credit. No education. Fucking debts. No savings. Identity theft. And somehow this shit doesn't seem to be a fucking problem for most others. The fucking bleakness of the world is almost enough to drive me to go on a mass homicidal rampage. That's just how fucking ridiculous this shit is. I feel like I will never be in a fucking place where I can expect a better quality of life. This shit can only get worse, and I fucking know that it can because I know people who are sleeping outside tonight in fucking DC in their cars because of this shit.

I am not grateful for this life in the least, and I wish death and disaster upon this country, which by it's institutions have run me into a destitution from which I may never fucking emerge. 

Hopelessness. That's all my life is. A fucking endless feedback loop of fucking problems that leads to one another. I have zero legitimate reasons to even stay alive other than for the fucking hell of it. But I'm not just surviving yet.

"I am 16M and a black male in a racist area in South Dakota. Whenever I'd make a friend as a little kid, their parents would shoo me away and tell their own kid I'm a criminal because I looked mean and dirty and my parents were. Even the Hispanic kids who get the same rap around here weren't allowed to talk to me. I wore the same clothes every day and rarely showered. It's the same problem as we have now. Technically we have running water and a shower, but it's so filthy and full of grime and backed up poo water that it's less disgusting to go without. I've been bullied and completely friendless since I was 11.

My parents have too high an income to qualify for social programs and spend all their money on drugs and eating out. They live like pigs and leave all their empties and hoarded things everywhere.

I know there are a lot of black people/poor people who have been successful and lived happy lives, but I am much different than them in that I am so easily broken. I am a shell of a person, and I developed epilepsy and another disability that limits my fine motor skills. I have seizures where I can't stop moving a limb repeatedly, lose consciousness for upwards of a minute, or both. It gets worse when I miss doses of medication. I have randomly vomited at times before being diagnosed and treated.

I stopped going to school when I was 14 because I had a seizure at school and pooped my pants. I am ""home schooled"". It doesn't matter if i have a diploma though when nobody wants to hire someone who could have seizures on work time. I'm going to just be on disability until I end it. Nobody cares about me and people who know me will be glad to have me gone.

I don't care if ""it gets better,"" and I won't call a suicide hotline. Please don't respond with clichÃ©s like that. I want you to tell me how to actually fix my life if you know how. If that doesn't work, I'll probably just end it because there is no point prolonging a useless life.",1

"Hello, I'm a 17 yo female high school senior.
So I have many problems, and I'm not going to point each of them out for the sake of keeping this post as short as possible.
I suffer from depression and loneliness and it's getting worse day by day.

Ever since I was in Kindergarten, I was always the odd one out. Honestly though, I don't think I'm at fault here.
Fast forward to middle school and high school, I was/am still alone all the time. Literally.

I'm always alone during recess and I haven't smiled genuinely in 2 years now. I do get happy sometimes but never smiled genuinely.
All the friendships I had just crashed and burned because me and the other person(s) never interacted much in real life or not interacted enough. 

Most of my ""strong"" friendships have been through messaging rather than real life reactions. I have never been in trouble or on an adventure with anyone when those stuff are exactly what makes the base of a real and strong friendship.

Not to mention that I have been made fun of a lot for my taste of music or the way I dress or why I never diet to lose a couple of pounds (seriously, I am fat but not obese.)

And because I went through a lot of difficulties during childhood and early adolescence and I had no one to advice me or be there for me, I've gotten really self conscious and insecure about almost everything. And I'll be honest here, I hate myself so much because of it and I have tried to commit suicide multiple times before.

Getting bullied, being underestimated and looked down upon by your classmates and teachers and also being left alone all the time does make one think ""why? Why am I the only one alone and why am I soooo hated and unwelcome everywhere? Am I such a bad person?"" And all those endless questions and the dark abyss of depression.

I have a strict dad who doesn't let me do most things others my age do and a mom who doesn't want me to defy my dad. Also, financially speaking, I don't come from a rich family like my classmates do but we have enough to live and afford a couple of luxuries.
I love my family so much but they have never understood my problems and struggles which is the main reason why I am the way I am right now. I'm pretty sure if we at least tried to understand each other, not just me but not one of my family members would suffer from a chronic depression and/or have thoughts of dying and committing suicide.
My family don't understand me, they love me but they don't understand me which is why I can't have a real deep conversation with any of them.

Recently, I have found quite a few good people as friends but because we all have our own priorities, we barely see each other and most of the time our interactions are through texts, and that way we won't have a strong and/or real friendship and I also think a lot about it because I honestly don't know what having friends is like... I don't want to be the only one who cares a lot about the others and would go to such extents for them but then after a while the whole friendship crashes and burns.
I want to tell them that I am here to stay but I also know that now is not the time because we have to have more real life interactions and know each other more.

Speaking of my other friendships... The friendships I considered to be real ended up with me being stabbed in the back and left alone with a broken heart.
And I found out that I had no real friends but everyone were just classmates when I considered them to be friends last year when I lost a very dear uncle whom I loved more than both my parents and considered myself to be his daughter, no one had my back then... No one told me to cheer up or at least kept me company until I was strong enough to overcome it.

Right now I am very exhausted of everything... I just want to relax a bit feeling respected and loved a little without worrying about who I am.

I just want to stop hating myself and start loving myself, build up my self esteem.

So tell me, great people of reddit, how do I stop hating myself, deal with loneliness and depression (preferably overcome both of them) and keep these new friendships I have made going without forcing any of those whom I deeply love and care about?

With kindest regards, ",1
"whatâs the point? why even try? all that i learned from this mess called âlifeâ is that there is no point in trying, life gets harder and harder every single day to lead up to what? more hard work and stress to get us to nothing in the end. we humans work our asses off 24/7 for fucking jackshit. excuse me for my profanity here but iâm being serious, what actually is the point of this torturous cycle called âlifeâ? all iâm willing to do right now is jump off an overpass because i canât do it all over again...",2
"It's like this: when I can't leave my bed, when I'm crying all the time, when I'm constantly late to work, when I haven't showered in weeks, I can tell myself: these are very clear, objective signs of depression. No wonder you're struggling with everything. Be kind to yourself.

When I'm able to hold a steady job without screwing up, when I can keep in touch with family pretty consistently, when I can clean my apartment: it makes all the things I still struggle with seem to be due to personal failings rather than disorder. So I hate myself.

I can't focus enough to watch a movie or read a book? Well, you can be on the internet for hours, so you're not trying hard enough to focus.

I've completely ghosted most of my friends? Well, you can still contact your family and two of your friends, so you're not really socially anxious; you're just an asshole.

I'm slow to speak and struggle to find words? Your brain is working better than when you were REALLY depressed, so you're a boring person with nothing interesting to say. By the way, you're a lot dumber now because the real depressive episodes ruined a bunch of brain matter.

I feel ""meh"" and numb all the time? You're not trying hard enough to experience new things. You get up to go to work; you should be able to easily get up and take a walk when you have the day off.

I don't know where I'm going with this.",2

"I never dreamt it could have lasted this long. It feels like every moment the feelings abate are really only a brief reprieve, the returning torment tears into my psyche with even less remourse. The corruption grows ever inside me, sometimes sleeping only to awake at times it needs to destroy.

The point of trauma feels so far away in time, nearly four years. When the episodes occur, it only feels as it happened just seconds prior. I have no physical ailments, only desolation of the mind. I haven't found an environment for healing, and I don't think I ever will. Isolation is sporadically maddening, not knowing if I'm truly losing my sanity or just feeling the pangs of past wrongdoings. Social circumstances are not helpful to the source of pain, when the episodes occur, all others can sense the turmoil and recoil at the possibility of backlash from this force.

It is a malevolent manifestation of my reality. All manner of action: speech, observation, hearing, all the surroundings are contorted to keep me bound to its dark will. None can even attempt to wrest control of the power it wields, its strength is insurmountable. I'm but a prisoner to its will, the slightest misstep in my path through life it sees an opportunity to grow and infest more within the spirit.

I feel as undeserving to face a plight so dire. It only exists when it feels the possibility to arise. I feel as though an instrument or vessel of its ill conceit. I look into a mirror to see a fair face staring back, crystal blue eyes, a symmetryÂ  throughout; many smiles from others abound me in my days, and I feel yet obligated to receive this blessing. My looks yet deceive my emotion, for I know a disgusted figure is writhing within. I cannot tell what yet be unattractive to most: a physical flaw or a scarring of the soul that only seeks to rend into another. I won't let my fellow man that deserve peace be upended in their stable life by a force so reckless.

So I reserve myself, keeping this force of trauma at bay from others, while enduring the suffering of its imprisonment. If love could break its chains that bind itself to me and I to it; it has not yet been gifted from those that radiate beauty throughout, or even a divine power to ease my pain. Society has disillusioned me of the agony I face. I am aware of flaws of the human nature that are best left ignored. Faced against this foe forces my consciousness to the dark reality.

I only wish I had an answer or remedy to this trouble, I fear that none may be found.",1

"Today I turned 40.  I'm supposed to have this life things pretty figured out, right?  not at all.

I'm alone, a recluse, a hermit.  I go out a few times every week to get groceries, but only at night when I have an easier time walking with less traffic and people inside the store.  That's the extent of my real human interaction. ""Hi, thanks, have a good day"".

I'm too frightened to make many changes to my life, even though I desperately need to.  Two years ago I tackled my drinking problem, that's solved and lost a bunch of weight. I figured i'd try and improve myself, do what I could first before asking for help.
I went crazy for a bit and threw out old stuff i'd been saving, like probably half of what I owned. My house has no furniture and everything is empty/barren, except for my one bedroom.

Now on antidepressants and seeing a psychiatrist.  I'm not sure how effective they are. I think they might help me focus a bit better on things i'd rather be focused on, but it's subtle.  I tried implying something more might be going on... or that I needed more help but my psychiatrist just seems fine with giving me SSRIs and atypical antipsychotics... just treating for depression/ocd... he doesn't seem interested in much beyond the norm and has never clearly come out and told me what my diagnosis was despite seeing him for like 6 months.

I've been unemployed for 2 years.
I have never driven a car.  I'll never have a family.
I'm not even sure i'll ever get another job. I don't feel like a person.

I struggle to do what's required for basic survival these days.
Lately i've been overeating and oversleeping.  I know it, I know how to prevent it by tracking calories and being mindful but like everything it's all so much work.

It's just difficult to see the point to any of this. My current plan of doing nothing is obviously not sustainable and not good for me... I just am unwilling to do anything about it.

If I get through another day without drinking, and manage to keep my house clean or did some other productive thing I try and say it's okay that I did good, but it's difficult cause I can say that however many times I want in my head and believe it but at the same time I still feel like I failed at life.  

I got no idea what to do.  Sell the house, move to the phillippines for a few years?  Just keep the status quo until they kick me out?  Get a job at Walmart or call center?  I dunno.  I got to do something different.  I wouldn't mind if someone just handed me a life in already good-working order and said ""here, trade up"".  I got no idea what a life that makes sense even looks like anymore.

I'm not sure what the point of this post is, I like just putting it down somewhere I guess and if people respond how they like that's okay too.

tldr; it's fine not to read it's just me babbling and mostly for myself anyhow.  maybe someone else can get something out of it.",3

*Personal*:I am 25 yo male,gay,was molested by a few guys at different times.I  have low self-esteem about my physique(dark toned,thin with glasses).I have dental fluorosis(dark yellowish teeth), so I never smiled or laughed with my mouth open.Became sort of addicted to porn,hookups between August 2016-May,2017-had poor performance in career. Did shitty things like cruising at public toilets/groping at busses,etc.. since 2013 at various times.
Even through all these confusions, I am quite social now with all the fellow interns. 
I never shared any of my problems because, no body gives a shit and they might take it as a way to tease me. I hate small talk/sharing of facts/any talk about movies.I usually am silent if I went for a group dinner. I find it pretty hard to talk in group,also, I do not remember such facts about which country has X resources/so on.

*Career*:Finished Masters in Engineering with above avg GPA. Got a job through campus.Now, doing a research Internship and planning for PhD.
**About current work:**In my present internship, I was given a development project which I was not interested at all.Every others were given some interesting research work.I could have finished mine earlier and switched to something else, but I am dragging the work for so longgggggg. In every weekly meeting, I just lie to the Prof. that I did something something.All the other interns have detailed slides of their past week's work, but I write it in 1 or 2 lines. So, I am the worst performing guy in the Lab(I have the potential, but the project is dull and in this period, I came to a good understanding of my behavior,sexuality,addictions and so on.Now I am on track-No hookups,no Fap,no addiction to porn).I was also addicted to chess--played for 4-5 hours straight daily while others were seriously working on their projects.

**What happened:** This New Year, I was not invited for a jungle camping which every other lab mates went.Around 10+ people went.I used to talk with everyone whenever I meet.Even I asked a guy, the day before what was his plan for New year, he said he is just gonna stay in room. Few days back, they didn't invite me for a dinner too.

I do not know what has caused them to ignore me. Most of them are from well-to-do family, but mine is still kind of unstable with debts.So, I never eat costlier outside food and wear same clothes again and again and never go out for watching movies/party. I am in the city for 4 years and have been to a few places every now and then alone and am not interested to go out nowadays.I went for a cycle ride 2 weeks back with one other girl intern without informing anyone.

**How I felt that day?**
I was pretty irritated. They gathered outside my room discussing with my roommate,before leaving for the party.My roommate too didn't invite me either.The next few hours, I was thinking what I did wrong? why they left me alone? Why that guy lied? and this affected my normal day-day activities.I took longer time than usual in everything. I relapsed to chatting with strangers for hookups and jerked off after 25+ days of NoFap. I spent around 9 hours watching porn/porn images/chat with strangers.

**How do I feel now?**
* I know God has different plans for me and this party/get together is not for me.
* I am gonna stop talking with everyone except the close ones and prove my worth by achieving a level higher than all those people.
* I started my 2018 pretty good, with some self reflection and new thoughts for my PhD admission. I am kind of between introvert and extrovert, so my room was the ideal place for me anytime.
*I set out a few goals for 2018 and I am on track.I have read 30 pages yesterday and continuing.Target: 100 books in 2018.
*I didn't drink or eat crazy and have a good start.

Though, everything is fine with me now,I would like to know any similar experiences and how people dealt with this. I am okay with not going for the party(bcoz, I would not have enjoyed as much as staying alone),but I could not handle the lie and the fact that everybody took great efforts to conceal this from me.

Tl;Dr: Not invited for the New Year celebration by lab mates.How to move forward??
Sorry if this is not the right subreddit to ask about this.",1
"Hey all,

Normally I try to muscle through these kinds of things on my own, but I'm having a rough go of things at the moment. Figured I'd make a post about it here and see what input some people have for me. I'm currently a 19 y/o ""sophomore"" in college, approaching what should (in theory) be my last semester at my local school before transferring to a 4-year school next fall. I'm now getting to the back end of my gen-eds, and one of the biggest reasons I went to a community college was to hopefully figure out what I wanted to do with my life. Coming out of high school and just picking a major seemed eternities away from anything I was capable of knowing, so I went the ""play it safe"" route.

I just feel as if I'm approaching a time where a decision needs to be made and I'm seriously bummed out about it right now. I've been all across the map as far as majors/program considerations are concerned, wanting to be a police officer through most of high school---&gt;being an English teacher---&gt;doing something with computers and IT----&gt;wanting to do film? As if now, I'm pretty certain that being a police officer/teacher are no longer of interest to me, but I'm juggling the most between computers and film of all things.

I've seen some older forum posts echoing similar sentiments, but really I'm just paralyzed with fear about making the wrong move. I'm generally pretty proficient with computers, but I have my doubts that I'd be able to keep up with the higher-level math requirements that come along with such a degree. I also wouldn't want to be a software dev or do coding really, and networking sounds boring to me. I just don't know of a sustainable career path that deals with troubleshooting hardware/software.

As far as film goes, I just really like video editing. Would pursue cinematography or something to that effect. With this one in particular I'm really concerned with being able to find work out of college, because so often we hear that these ""fine art"" esque degrees are a big no-no if you want job security and that's really important to me. Film school is also expensive so you have to be pretty grounded in your decision to attend. Despite the fact that I am not really cut out for a STEM related field (I've always performed better in liberal arts classes) I feel like I'd never find work.

This past semester I decided I'd not concern myself with gen-eds as much (only took Bio to get it out of the way) and have the rest be electives. In my case, I took two CIS classes (stands for Computer Information Systems), which were okay, but felt a lot like ""how to use microsoft office"" classes. Not necessarily super representative of the entire field. I even took a career class to get some more insight into potential paths. Helped a little bit but not as much as I envisioned it would.

Sorry for the essay. Bottom line is I just feel like the clock is ticking and I'm feeling seriously depressed and anxious. I can't stop thinking about it. Everyone seems to be finding a path that works for them, grinding out their coursework, while I'm sitting here twiddling my thumbs throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks. I feel like I'll never get to where I need to be :(

Thanks for reading this and taking the time to respond, if you decide to. Any and all feedback is seriously appreciated, I'm sure I could use it. Have a great evening everybody and happy NYE.",2
"damn, at least some fcking alcohol would have made this shitty, depressing-ass night a little easier. that's what everyone else is doing anyway, getting black-out drunk. but instead, in all my sober consciousness, i got to watch a bunch of happy excited people with bright eyes out in times square kissing each other and doing anything at all in their lives at midnight tonight.",3
"Sorry, this is my first reddit post ever because I'm really good at lurking but not at contributing to anything. I'm starting my second semester of college at IUS soon, and I'm really excited because it's my only way I get to go out and do things besides staying home and slowing drifting towards wanting to die. 

Every day I hope I make a new friend but I realize I'm wrong and I go home feeling like shit because I feel like everyone thinks I'm as shitty I as I feel I am. I asked this guy I liked out after I embarrassed myself the day before and I fucked everything up; I lost all chance of dating I had with him. Everyday is just another day for me to feel lonely. On the last day of drawing class we had I started violently crying before class at my easel because I'm a weak piece of shit. I got a 3.5 gpa on my first semester back though and that makes me feel really happy.

I can't even think of what to say when I try to talk to people; I always draw blanks in my mind and I end up just awkwardly being there with nothing to say and nothing to contribute. I'm only able to be friends with people who are able to put up with my shit and are able to put effort into being with me because I'm barely putting enough effort into being alive.

I still have hope though that good things will happen to me and make me feel like I'm an actual person and not a corpses that just goes day to day doing nothing. 

I'm also going to this sleepover thing for the new years and I hope I'm able to make friends. This will be my first new years I celebrate at somewhere other than my home.",1
"Anyone else stay with someone that watches over you and takes care of you?
Im so thankful for my man but I also feel bad I hate how I stay here in bed, or when I go days without showering.. I hate how I neglect myself and dont give as much intimacy as I should and then question if he gets it somewhere else.. times Im just so depressed Ill say or do absolutely nothing or Ill have meltdowns I just feel like a burden and a high matenience hastle I just feel so bad cause I was abandoned by my own family and have to be cared for by his..
Im considered smi (seriously mentally ill) too and dont do well on my own.. seroquel has helped keep me stabile but instead of getting mania like I used too just tend to be on a consistent level of depression",3
"I am terrified.

I am terrified because something inside of me is broken. Even as I write this, I am overwhelmed, because it Is impossible to describe it. I do not know how to describe it. The closest thing to it is hell. It is a state when all of your worst fears come to life. When your paranoia is palpable in the air. 

It is the place, when you were a child, that you could never even conceive of. Perhaps when you had a momentary glimpse of it in your bad dreams at night, but then you woke up.  Now that you are older, you live in it.  Your life is literally a nightmare.

My mind has taken everything away from me. The bipolar disorder which came unto me in early adulthood destroyed my life. It took away all of my relationships and capacity to have relationships. It took away all of my hopes and dreams. It ruined my reputation and took away any career prospects.  The idea of being homeless, discarded, abandoned and left to rot is a very real thing that is facing me. There is no bottom. Even when you reach it, you just keep pushing yourself further down, wallowing in your own guilt. The only real support I have left are my parents, and I donât know for how much longer. I have caused them so much stress already. I have caused them to worry so much- how can one live with so many weights to bear on top of their original insanity?

I am in a place where everything Is dark. With feelings of inner death and hopelessness that make you want to crawl into a corner and cry.  The worst of it is the confusion. Knowing that you have tried everything, that nothing worked, and so you have no idea what you are even supposed to do anymore in life. Everything contradicts itself. Everything is a double-bind. Everything feels like a dead end, and every step forward feels like a step back.  So, youâre stuck. Worse still, you have no one to blame but yourself, so thatâs what you do, and thatâs of no use either.

So youâve become an expert in patience and endurance. You endure the shitstorm that is your reality. You grin and bear it, hoping it make it through another day.  You wonder how is it possible for a sentient being to be able to experience something so terrifying and painful. You also wonder what you did to deserve this- and if karma is real, then yeah, you deserve it.  There you are at it again- breaking yourself in, harder and harder.  Non-stop negativity, hostile and intrusive thoughts.  You donât want to be around others because it makes no sense. How could they be normal, have a sincere smile, and you are like this? It doesnât compute- it just hurts you more and makes you feel even more lonely.  So you live alone and isolated, and you wait it out. Minutes turn into hours, turn into days, turn into weeks, turn into months, turn into years.  Year after year goes by, and you experience some periods of normalcy or perhaps even joy, some success, but then as surely as the seasons alternate, your depression comes back stronger than ever as if on cue, and takes away any progress you have made.  It destroys any newfound hope you were able to cultivate and nurture.  It makes you once again cut off all ties, run away, and there you are again, once again cowering in your own little corner, your personal hell.

You hear all the naive New-Agers say âjust go for it!â, âcarpe diemâ, âyou only live once!â, âyou always have the choice to be happyâ ""you can always turn your life around""â¦ and you know, it just breaks my mind even more.  They donât understand, and you cannot make them understand, that this is not how it works, not for you. No, I am not some victimized snowflake, but there is something broken in my brain, in my soul. Some of the buttons, some of the options you have, for me, they are disabled. I do not have these same options, and no, it is not just because I believe that. I could live in delusion and convince myself otherwise, but it would change nothing.  Iâm just fucking doomed like this, you see?   Yes of course, that makes me the toxic negative person, as if I enjoyed it. Rest assured, I donât.  Oh and by the way, earlier on, I was able to turn my life around. I called on the help of some divine and holy miracle and relentless self-discipline and truly did turn my life around, but in the end, it never lasts. It always, without exception, gets taken away. Now, I am no longer able to call in the supernatural, the impossible. I can no longer will myself. 

Itâs something that we experience that most people donât. Perhaps they have had brief periods of hell, but not for as long as we do.  Every moment, I wish I were dead. I cannot kill myself for the typical reasons- it will hurt others and maybe, just maybe, there could be hope for something better one day, even though it may be inconceivable now.   

Personally, Iâm really looking forward to the day of my death. Why? So that when I have my life review, I can finally know WHY?  Why all this pain, why all this suffering, for what?  I can look my guardian angel in the eye without any regrets and tell him: âlook motherfucker, I did the best I could. I tried everything. There was absolutely nothing more I could do. Donât you fucking dare tell me I could have been more âopenâ, or âlovingâ. I tore my heart out to find my inner love, but there was noneâ.

So then by whatever process, I would be made to know, to understand why, and I hope to God that if reincarnation is real, that my next lifetime could be normal and joyous.   So far as I can see it, I do not feel that this kind of pain and suffering could be anything other than a) a punishment or b) a test of endurance. I can say with complete confidence that I have not learned or benefited in any way from my bipolar disorder. If anything, it has caused and continues to cause harm to myself and all those around me, and the worst of it is that there is absolutely nothing I can do about it.    Happy new year.",3
Such a terrible feeling. That my existence is comical to others,1
"Iâve posted here a lot over the last year on both this account and others. Iâve struggled with depression and anxiety for a very long time and it felt like things werenât going to get any better. I was giving up. 
However, about 4 months ago I had perhaps the worse mental breakdown In my life. Everything kind of happened at once and I hit rock bottom. I couldnât bring myself to go to work. I spent my days in my room crying. I was angry and miserable. I was a mess. 
Eventually my sister and brother in law came to my aid and pushed me to get better. We found me a new less stressful job away from my triggers. I opened up about my mental illness. I got a new doctor who took interest in my problems and prescribed me medication and guides to conquer them. I started a new job that I really enjoy. I also started dating this guy that has gone through some of the same struggles and understands how I feel. 
Itâs been an incredible 4 months. I know itâs not this easy for others but I got lucky. I also want to thank the people who would give me advice. Thanks guys! Happy New Year! ",3
"JUst need to ramble a little. Over 30 years of life it is not encouraging where I've gotten. Don't even feel worth trying to reach out to a friend. Afraid we weren't close enough for her to be cool with where I'm at, plus don't know how to talk that isn't just saying run away from me. Drifted from my oldest friend and know I'm cast aside there. Feel another coming. Went through the most humiliating time of my life and have zero support system. Just a complete failure. No confidence in treatment helping anymore. I just don''t even want to try anymore. tired of meds, tired of empty promises. Too afraid to do anything. Waste. Hugs are never coming. Conversations are never coming. If this doesn't work and I already completely doubt it then I'm scared of whats next. Nrear the end. back at bottom again. you arent supposed to return to bottom. no interest in hobbies anymore. failure, waste. this shit will never work because I won't let it WTF! deserve to die. Never going to get better. only make it worse. fuck you. please just end me. what happened?",2
"I think the relationship btw money and ur mental health is just direct! If i have so much money i guess i wouldn't be so damn miserable!

I guess peope are right, if u ain't making money u ain't living!
I am just so jealous of rich people that how much they can do and enjoy their life with.

Let's just all admit that happiness is really purely depend on how much freaking money you have, we need to stop telling people or ourselves that money isn't everything, this kind of denial mentality is so toxic!

The more and sooner we realize it's the fact the sooner we will be able to end our lives. Don't u agree with me?
It will never be better, it's just not! It's been so many years, things won't get better, period! We need to face it! I just don't have the balls to end it right now but it is the only way to get out- DEATH. 

I hope we all eventually have the guts to do it, new year's wish-I just hope I can die this year, let me outttt! I can't stand not one second! I need to die soon! I need to jump to the rail or something!

"Hi everyone. I just wanted to clear something up. Two months ago, my mild symptoms had started and progressively got worse. About a month ago, I was moderately depressed but a video triggered what I thought was euphoria in me. I have experienced moderate anxiety episodes before. At first, it didn't feel like it, I felt realllly good, but then I thought, ""I haven't felt like this, my heart is racing, this must be anxiety"" and then it changed to another anxiety episode. I think it lasted for an hour and a half. So, my question is, has anyone experienced this euphoria along with depression? I'm consulting a psychiatrist, but I feel guilty about calling her up all the time.",3
